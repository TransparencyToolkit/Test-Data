DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Practical Jokes and April Fools<br>FROM: the Sigint Communications Team<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 04/01/2003<br><br>(U) An enemy decoy, built in occupied Holland, led to a tale that has been told and retold ever<br>since by Allied pilots. The German "airfield," constructed with meticulous care, was made almost<br>entirely of wood. There were wooden hangars, oil tanks, gun emplacements, trucks, and<br>aircraft. The Germans took so long in building their wooden decoy that Allied photo experts had<br>more than enough time to observe and report it. The day finally came when the decoy was<br>finished, down to the last wooden plank. And early the following morning, a lone RAF plane<br>crossed the Channel, came in low, circled the field once, and dropped a large wooden bomb.<br>(U) On the subject of practical jokes-- where did April Fools come from? As far as anybody can<br>tell, the history of April Fools' Day is somewhat obscure. The most popular theory seems to be<br>that the tradition dates back to 1582 in France, the first country to switch from the Julian to the<br>Gregorian Calendar, which moved New Year's Day to 1 January. Prior to 1582, the new year was<br>an 8-day celebration that culminated on 1 April. Because communications in 1582 were not<br>what they are now, some people didn't get word of the change. Others simply resisted the<br>change and continued to celebrate the new year on 1 April. These people were labeled "fools"<br>and were subject to ridicule and other practical jokes, such as being sent on "fool's errands."<br>Over time, this practice evolved into the current tradition of harmless pranks.<br>(U) Regardless of its origins, April Fools' Day has spawned numerous classic hoaxes, many now<br>celebrated on the Internet-where the "Top Ten" list has evolved to the "Top 100." Mentioned in<br>almost every source that discusses the holiday and appearing at the number one spot on the<br>Top Ten list is the Swiss Spaghetti Harvest. In 1957 a respected British documentary program<br>ran a story on 1 April announcing a bumper Swiss spaghetti crop, complete with footage of Swiss<br>farmers pulling strands of spaghetti down from trees. Huge numbers of viewers called in<br>wanting to know how they could grow their own spaghetti trees.<br>(U) Occupying the number 10 slot and billed as the oldest April Fools' Day prank is the elaborate<br>1708 scheme that began with the publication in February of that year of Isaac Bickerstaff's<br>almanac predicting the death of famous London astrologer John Partridge on 29 March. On 30<br>March, Bickerstaff published a follow up pamphlet announcing that he'd been right and Partridge<br>was dead. On 1 April, Partridge was awakened by a sexton wanting to know about his funeral<br>sermon. When Partridge walked down the street, people reportedly told him he looked exactly<br>like someone they knew who had died. Isaac Bickerstaff actually was a pseudonym for satirist<br>Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels. Swift's intent had been to discredit Partridge as a<br>fraud and force him to stop publishing his own almanac of astrological predictions.<br>(U) So beware... and Happy Fools' Day!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
