DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Customer Feedback Made Easier<br>FROM:<br>Technical Director, Customer Gateway<br>Run Date: 06/09/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) A new version of the customer feedback form will become operational on Tuesday,<br>10 June. This new form is designed to make data entry by analysts easier while focusing in on<br>key questions that SID believes are critical to a better feedback process.<br>(U//FOUO) The new form reduces the number of questions from more than 10 to just 3 - an<br>assessment of product value, product usage, and customer comments. The new form also allows<br>for entry of feedback for more than one SIGINT product at a time. It is available on the NSA web<br>at "go sigintfeedback" for proxy entry by NSA personnel and a version on INTELINK for direct<br>entry by customers will be available soon.<br>(U//FOUO) The redesign is the work of a Feedback Tiger Team, commissioned by the SID<br>Director last fall and consisting of representatives from the Directorate for Customer<br>Relationships and the Directorate for Analysis and Production. The Tiger Team focused on<br>identifying key impediments to effective customer feedback and developed the requirements for<br>this new form. This is only the first version of the new form. A future version on NSA net,<br>scheduled for release later this year, will add interaction with the PLUS database to facilitate<br>even easier processes.<br>(U//FOUO) Even with this small step, the critical element in the entire feedback process is to<br>have all meaningful customer feedback documented and entered in our feedback database.<br>Approximately 5% of all product currently has documented feedback, but this is only a fraction<br>of the feedback that NSA'ers have gathered in their regular encounters with customers. The next<br>goal of the Tiger Team will be to convince every analyst of the importance of his effort and their<br>role in its success. Look for more information on this effort in the near future.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
