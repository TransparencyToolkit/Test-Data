DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) A Call to Alms<br>FROM:<br>CFC Senior Keyworker for SID<br>Run Date: 11/17/2003<br><br>(U) As the SID Senior Keyworker for this year's Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), I'd like to<br>take a moment to thank those of you who have contributed so far this year, and encourage<br>those of you who are still considering your contribution. In addition, I would like to recognize<br>and thank all the SID Keyworkers, canvassers and coordinators for the job you do daily within<br>your respective organizations.<br>(U) As you may know, NSA is the largest contributor to CFC in Central Maryland, an<br>accomplishment of which our workforce can be proud. Last year, NSA gave $1,369,836.40 to the<br>CFC; SID contributed $581,179.06 of that amount. What's even more noteworthy: only 20% of<br>the Agency workforce (and 17% of the SID workforce) participated in the 2002 Campaign.<br>That's a lot of money from a relatively small percentage of our population. NSA's goal this year<br>is $1,400,000 and a 25% participation rate. So far, we've received $1,155,269.25 in pledges.<br>We need your contribution to meet our Agency goal, but, far more important, the people and<br>causes that benefit from the Campaign rely on your contribution every day. Your gift makes a<br>significant difference towards improving the lives of many individuals and the world around us.<br>(U) There are many, many causes that need our support-- the list of CFC recipients is long and<br>there is something for everyone. Whatever your charitable interest-- children, the elderly,<br>hospice care, homeless shelters, domestic violence, nature conservation, welfare-to-work<br>programs, pets on wheels, or perhaps a disease that has touched you or a loved one... it's all<br>there in CFC.<br>(U) I invite you all to take a look at the CFC homepage ("go cfc"). Civilian personnel can set up<br>payroll deduction from this page-- this is relatively painless way to give-- but CFC also accepts<br>donations in the form of cash or check. (Military personnel may participate in NSA's CFC through<br>one-time cash or check donation, however their payroll deductions have to go through their<br>branch of service.) We'll even reward you just for contributing-- with either a<br>print, paperweight, first aid kit, or key chain flashlight, depending on your level of giving. While<br>you're on the website, check out the Top 10 Reasons to Give, the Shape Count game, and the<br>End of Campaign drawing.<br>(U) As Thanksgiving approaches, most of us have much to be grateful for-- family, friends,<br>employment, health, or maybe a new car or a vacation to look forward to. As we celebrate and<br>give thanks for our bounty, take some time to consider those less fortunate who benefit from all<br>the wonderful causes the CFC supports. NSA needs YOU to help reach our goal of $1,400,000.<br>Please go on-line or contact your CFC representative and Make your donation today !
