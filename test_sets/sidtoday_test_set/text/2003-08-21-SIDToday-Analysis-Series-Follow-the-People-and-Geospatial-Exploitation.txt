Alternately, what if you are<br>interested in a facility and you want to know who's in it? Follow the<br>People and Geospatial Exploitation are two additional analytic<br>methodologies available to support SIGINT analysts.<br>(C ) Follow the People<br>(S//SI) Follow the People is a major, Intelligence Communityrecognized, SIGINT endeavor to track "bad guys" around the<br>globe. It is playing a significant role in fighting the Global War on<br>Terrorism and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The best organizational<br>model for "people tracking" is a model in which all available<br>SIGINT skills and data sources are brought together to shed light<br>on an individual and his social network--effective teaming is the<br>key to success in these activities. This approach is more successful<br>when there are multiple data sources to be correlated, yielding<br>more potential leads.<br>(S//SI) One organization that "Follows the People" extensively is<br>Counterintelligence and HUMINT Support (CIHS). CIHS develops a<br>full understanding of the targeted person and determines his<br>whereabouts for the purposes of recruitment or capture. CIHS does<br>a lot of SIGINT support to operational HUMINT activities; the best<br>results are achieved when the HUMINTers work with CIHS on<br>operational objectives and help focus attention on key areas.<br>Usually, CIHS uses contact-chaining techniques in its SIGINT<br>development, but occasionally they exploit communications that a<br>HUMINT organization has put in place or directly enabled. To gain<br>additional SIGINT sources, CIHS is attempting to develop<br>information on passenger charter companies and their flight plans,<br>manifests, etc. SIGINT support to HUMINT operations is tailored to<br>the particulars of each specific operation.<br>(C ) Geospatial Expoitation<br>(TS//SI) The Geospatial Exploitation Office is leading the effort to<br>develop the tools and techniques for a different approach to target<br>development. While traditional contact-chaining techniques<br>continue to serve as a powerful developmental tool, a purely<br>geospatially-based approach to target development can be more<br>significant. Using powerful geographic information systems tools<br>like ArcView, a geospatially-oriented approach can be particularly<br>effective at finding things such as safehouses, ingress/egress<br>"ratlines," meeting sites or hide sites, suspect sites, or VIP<br>facilities. Such an approach recently scored a success in Operation<br>Iraqi Freedom, when emitters were geolocated to VIP<br>neighborhoods, dachas, palaces, etc., revealing a series of satellite<br>telephones serving senior Iraqi regime members and influential<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Analysis<br>1.

These techniques have also allowed analysts to locate<br>and track Al Aa'da associates and discover a vast and dispersed<br>network of Iranian agents in Iraq serving the Iranian Ministry of<br>Intelligence or the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).<br>(TS//SI) The SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) DNI Cell of the<br>Counterterrorism Product Line uses geospatial exploitation to track<br>terrorists as they transition from communications mode to<br>communications mode, and provides this data to production<br>element analysts and customers in a timely manner. The Cell has<br>further expanded its existing SIGDEV partnerships throughout the<br>community to help locate specific terrorist targets. This increased<br>collaboration resulted in the arrests of 6 individuals in Buffalo, New<br>York--SIGINT reporting provided key leads and valuable<br>information which enabled FBI analysts to identify the terrorist cell<br>and advance their investigative efforts. Geolocational Exploitation,<br>like "Follow the People", directly supports active operations-operations to find certain people and physically target them,<br>operations to find a way to make contact and recruit or capture<br>them, or operations in which law enforcement takes action to deter<br>a crime.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
