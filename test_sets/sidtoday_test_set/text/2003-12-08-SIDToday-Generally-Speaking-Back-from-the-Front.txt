DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Generally Speaking: Back from the Front<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 12/08/2003<br><br>(U/FOUO) I just got back from a short visit to Iraq and, I can tell you, no matter how often we<br>say it, "there is nothing like being there." Before going over, I thought I knew the contributions<br>made by SIGINT'ers to this effort. But, walking in their shoes and watching the work they do,<br>under harsh conditions, I now truly understand that the SIGINT'ers deployed to Iraq are heroes.<br>Total professionals...every one of them!<br>(S//SI) I visited what could be called the SCS (Special Collection Service) site in Baghdad. First<br>of all, the breadth of knowledge held by these individuals is nothing short of amazing. I was very<br>impressed with the complex, high tech site that was set up in such a short time. The civilians<br>that operate this site are exposed to all the risks that come with living in a war zone but these<br>folks are not deterred.<br>(S//SI) We had a chance to see a site run by the 1st Armored Division, 501st MI Charlie<br>Company. Let me tell you, the OSHA people (Occupational Safety and Health Agency) would not<br>be too keen on the way these folks get to their place of business. The site is on top of one of<br>Saddam's bombed out palaces. A stairway that leads to the roof has been altered by U.S.<br>ordnance and there is a huge gap between the stair treads and any surrounding wall. One false<br>step and you're in trouble!<br>(U//FOUO) The CSG (Cryptologic Service Group) and the remarkable TAREX (Target<br>Exploitation) Team are all well known by the fighting forces. It was heartwarming to see that<br>these and all of the SIGINT'ers in country are well accepted by the combat arms people. I can<br>guarantee that this experience is something none of them will ever forget. It will change their<br>lives and influence every SIGINT decision they make from now on.<br>(U//FOUO) I learned many things on this trip. Among the most important is that getting good<br>intel is best accomplished with conversation - a two-way dialogue. The folks on the ground know<br>a lot of things that can make our jobs easier and more effective. We are going to have to find a<br>way to take advantage of what they know instead of relying only on what they want.<br>(U) Another encouraging thing I learned is that the closer you get to the street, the better<br>things look. The general support from the Iraqi people is reason for optimism. Along with that<br>optimism we must remember that we have a responsibility to do our very best at our jobs, each<br>day...every day. Knowing what I know about your professionalism, I have no doubt you will.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
