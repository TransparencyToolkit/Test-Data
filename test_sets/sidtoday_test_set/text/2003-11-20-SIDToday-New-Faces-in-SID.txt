DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) New Faces in SID<br>FROM: SIGINT People Office/<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 11/20/2003<br><br>(U) Our Future is Now<br>(U) For the first time in over a decade more people are joining the NSA workforce than leaving<br>it. Did you know that the SIGINT Directorate hired 472 new employees in FY03? Existing hiring<br>levels are expected to continue to increase!<br>(U) Those of you who have been here for a while and are experienced employees have probably<br>noticed many of the new faces. It's been many years since we've had the opportunity to<br>welcome, train and mentor so many new people. You may not realize how valuable your<br>knowledge and experience are to the future of our SIGINT mission. In truth, what you do to help<br>our current generation of employees can be just as vital to our mission as the knowledge and<br>skills that you use to serve your country each and every day. We have the unique opportunity to<br>share our ideals, knowledge, and visions with the future SIGINT workforce!<br>(U) Those of you who are newly hired employees don't need anyone to tell you what it is like to<br>be new to NSA. You are living the experience. The NSA culture and environment may be unlike<br>anything you have ever encountered in your career. Perhaps there are some things you can do<br>to help make your transition to our great organization easier.<br>(U) How can all employees help each other during this time of transition?<br>(U) Both managers and colleagues alike can make a tremendous impact on our new employees.<br>Taking a moment to welcome them and find out about their past experiences and current<br>expectations can make a big difference in their initial impression of NSA. While mentoring is a<br>meaningful and effective way to bring a new employee into the organization, it shouldn't be a<br>substitute for on-going encouragement, open communication, and the continuous sharing of<br>information. Be open to the ideas of these new and enthusiastic team members. Their energy<br>can be a wonderful complement to our existing environment. Part of their initial contribution will<br>be their fresh perspective.<br>(U) In fact, new employees should ask numerous questions and offer many ideas! As a new hire,<br>remember the virtue of patience. There are many new things to learn and to understand. Many<br>of your ideas are excellent; however, it may take time to see them come to fruition. Absorb as<br>much knowledge from your co-workers as you can. The lessons that can be learned from your<br>co-workers may prove invaluable to you as you begin your career at NSA. It just may surprise<br>you as to where they have been and what they have accomplished during their careers here!<br>(U) SIGINT is a success story that is continuously adapting and ever changing. With each<br>passing moment, we impact that story and affect its ultimate outcome. Let's ensure our<br>continued success by learning and growing together. Recognizing and appreciating our vast<br>experiences and backgrounds is a big part of this effort. By working together, our impressive<br>past will become our successful future!<br>(U//FOUO) POCs:<br><br> and<br><br> Workforce Advocacy Team <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
