This is an outstanding opportunity for motivated, mature, operations oriented<br>personnel to make a difference.<br>(U//FOUO) The National Intelligence Support Team (NIST)/Field Sustainment Branch (S1312) is<br>currently looking for qualified military personnel from all services to fill 25 newly allocated<br>billets. These personnel will be permanently assigned to S1312 for the duration of their tour at<br>NSA. During this tour of duty these personnel will deploy to several different NIST/CSG/Direct<br>Support Team positions worldwide for 90 to 120 days at a time in direct support of combat<br>forces engaged in the global war on terrorism (GWOT) and any other national level crises that<br>may arise.<br>(U//FOUO) There are five Officer-in-Charge (OIC) billets (O-3) and twenty Analyst billets (E-5<br>through E-7) that need to be filled. All potential applicants must have a SIGINT background.<br>Experience in support to military operations and force protection are also desired, but not<br>necessarily a requirement. Analysts must have an analytic background, preferably with a formal<br>school foundation.<br>(U//FOUO) Selected personnel will forward deploy and integrate into our teams on the front lines<br>of the GWOT. These teams directly impact operations by providing the combat elements with<br>time-sensitive, relevant intelligence products that directly and immediately affect targeting and<br>operations on many different levels and scales. Additionally, these teams are also responsible for<br>providing critical force protection information to the tactical commanders in order to protect the<br>lives and interests of our forces and those of our allies within their area of responsibility (AOR).<br>(U//FOUO) The NIST Branch, in coordination with several Agency offices, will train and equip all<br>deploying personnel. Training will include extensive analysis training (classroom and OJT), target<br>specific training, weapons training, as well as personal protective measures training (self<br>defense, defensive driving, etc.) and more.<br>(U//FOUO) Currently, S13 has several teams deployed worldwide in support of the GWOT. If you<br>are interested in these opportunities, send your resume to the NIST Branch via e-mail: DL<br>NIST_resume or <br>@ems.nsa. Contact the office at<br> if you<br>should have additional questions.<br>(U//FOUO) Primary and Alternate POCs for NIST, Field Sustainment Branch: Chief, NIST Field<br>Sustainment Division - CWO3<br>, USMC (<br>) NIST/CSG Desk Officer - CTRC<br>(SW/AW/NAC) <br> USN <br>) SGT <br> USMC, (<br>) CPL <br>, USMC, (<br>)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
