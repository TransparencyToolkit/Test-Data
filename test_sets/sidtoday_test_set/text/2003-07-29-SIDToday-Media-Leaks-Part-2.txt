If you<br>missed part 1, click HERE to see it.<br>(U) What Happens When a CI Is Discovered?<br>(U) Once there is a CI, what happens? If a first-time disclosure of classified NSA information<br>appears in press, NSA's Public Affairs Office notifies DIRNSA and prepares notification letters to<br>the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). NSA's Office of<br>the General Counsel (OGC) advises DIRNSA whether the matter involves a possible criminal<br>case; if so, it is referred to the DOD General Counsel, and then finally to the Department of<br>Justice for investigation.<br>(U) Media leaks are rarely prosecuted. Why? Often because they are hard to prove, but in some<br>cases officials are reluctant to prosecute for fear that the case will attract even more attention<br>than the original disclosure. (Nevertheless, people who release classified information without<br>authorization are subject to a range of punishments, from loss of clearance to dismissal to<br>criminal prosecution.) Meanwhile, the OPI at NSA scrambles to minimize (if possible) the<br>damage from the disclosure, and informs its customers that our capabilities may take a hit.<br>(U) What Is My Role?<br>(S//SI) Obviously, Cryptologic Insecurities constitute a real danger to our ability to produce<br>SIGINT. What can you do about it?<br>Stay alert for reflections of impairment or denial-or-deception practices by our<br>adversaries in your target traffic.<br>If you note an impairment of NSA's ability to collect against a target, please notify<br>Intelligence Security Issues. They will try to determine if there was a CI.<br>When watching/reading press reports, remain conscious of potential reflections of SIGINT<br>information.
