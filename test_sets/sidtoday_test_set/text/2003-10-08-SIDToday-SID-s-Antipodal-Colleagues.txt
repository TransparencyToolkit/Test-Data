DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID 's Antipodal Colleagues<br>FROM:<br>Deputy SUSLO Canberra<br>Run Date: 10/08/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) SUSLO Canberra (SUSLOC) has 16 people working to<br>improve already great relations between NSA and our partners in<br>Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, the NSA-Defence Signals<br>Directorate (DSD) relationship is the strongest and most longstanding of the bilateral intelligence relationships and serves as an<br>example for other agencies. SUSLOC is a vital part of the U.S.<br>Embassy, Canberra, community; the chief is a member of the<br>Australia Country Team and takes part in daily intelligence<br>meetings with the Ambassador and senior staff. The recentlyestablished Associate SUSLOC position in Wellington will help<br>establish closer ties with the U.S. Embassy in New Zealand. The<br>A/SUSLOC position provides both liaison and technical support for<br>many areas of cooperation between NSA and New Zealand's<br>Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).<br>(C) The United States and Australia have been drawn together<br>dramatically in recent years as a result of increased concerns over<br>terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and weapons of mass destruction.<br>Australia has supported all major U.S. initiatives, providing force<br>protection for U.S. troops in the area and deploying troops in<br>Afghanistan and Iraq. Examples of ongoing efforts include<br>cooperation with Australian authorities to ensure security and<br>secure communications for the October visit to Australia by the<br>U.S. President, joint efforts to counteract threats to the upcoming<br>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Bangkok, and<br>U.S. assistance to DSD following the October 2002 Bali bombing.<br>(S//SI) We cooperate with DSD and GCSB in major areas such as<br>reporting, collection, SIGINT development, counterterrorism,<br>information assurance, ELINT, cryptology, and sensitive areas like<br>close access. NSA and DSD worked together to support military<br>operations during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi<br>Freedom. Significant examples include OCMC and GEOCELL support<br>to DSD and the Australian Special Air Service, SSA support to DSD<br>for possible Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations, sharing<br>of Blue Force tracking, and integration of Australians into the CSG<br>in Baghdad. A continuing success story is the provision and<br>exchange of linguists among U.S., Australian, and New Zealand<br>cryptologic platforms to include ships and aircraft.<br>(TS//SI) Other areas where we are expanding cooperation with<br>DSD include reverse engineering: NSA integrees mentor both<br>cryptomathematicians and engineers while tackling the encrypted<br>Very Small Aperature Terminal (VSAT) network used by the Papua<br>New Guinea Defence Force, a goal mentioned in the DSD Director's<br>business plan. Another notable success highlights close NSA and<br>DSD cooperation on counterterrrorism, resulting in SIGINT reports<br>tying high value targets in the Middle East and the Philippines to<br>extremists in Southeast Asia. These reports led to a number of<br>terrorists being detained in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. GCSB is<br>working closely with NSA and DSD to track terrorists in the region<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Second Party<br>SIGINT Cooperation<br>1.
