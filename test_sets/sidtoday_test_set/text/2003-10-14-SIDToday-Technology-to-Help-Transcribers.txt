DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S) Technology to Help Transcribers<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 10/14/2003<br><br>(S//SI) As we all know, the volume of communications around the world has been increasing<br>exponentially in recent years. Many SID offices have searched for new ways - using the latest<br>technology - to find a means for keeping pace with this explosion. There are many tools being<br>developed to help us better separate the wheat from the chaff, allowing our limited pool of<br>analysts to concentrate on what is truly important. One such effort is FORESTPROWL, an R&amp;D;<br>effort using Phonetic Indexing technology from Nexidia (formerly Fast-Talk).<br>(S//SI) With their corps of highly-qualified Spanish transcribers dwindling steadily, more traffic<br>than they could process coming in, and a target that didn't lend itself to processing by other<br>tools, the Office of International Crime and Narcotics (ICN) went looking for help. ICN eventually<br>undertook a proof-of-concept project using a commercial software product developed by a<br>research consortium to identify high-potential collected voice files. ICN contracted with ACS<br>Defense to test the software under SIGINT conditions and to prove that it could identify<br>specified words in a body of voice files.<br>(S//SI) The ultimate goal is to build a capability to help prioritize voice files for transcription<br>based on analyst-built criteria. The FORESTPROWL software will provide the phoneme (unit of<br>speech) "diary" of the content, and a separate engine will search and score the files for<br>prioritization based on analytic input. Not only will it point to the highest-potential files, but it<br>will also be a way of capturing senior analytic knowledge, since expert analysts know best what<br>nuggets to search for and will use that knowledge to drive the selection/scoring engines.<br>Another benefit of this effort is that junior language analysts will be more productive while in a<br>learning mode: they will be processing the highest potential traffic rather than wading through<br>myriad files to find the best information.<br>(S//SI) Encouraged by the results of the proof-of-concept effort, ICN is moving forward, using<br>DCIP (The Defense Counterdrug Intelligence Program) money to build a complete tool, with the<br>Nexidia engine as the centerpiece. A tweaking of the acoustical model is already underway. ICN<br>is working with R6 to build a scoring model, and with NUCLEON (multimedia database)<br>developers to integrate FORESTPROWL into the voice processing architecture. At the same time,<br>the Nexidia is working on developing phoneme patterns for other languages. They have recently<br>completed an Arabic model and are working on other Asian languages at this time. Although<br>developed in ICN, it is hoped that the FORESTPROWL effort will prove useful to language<br>analysts throughout the SIGINT enterprise.<br>(U//FOUO) POCS: <br>Technical Director, Office of International Crime and Narcotics, <br> ACS Project Lead,<br> SAIC Technical Lead,<br>SAIC Project Lead, <br> CACI Project Lead,<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
