DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID Leadership Offsite: Believing in Magic<br>FROM: Charles Berlin<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 05/27/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) "I believe in magic," stated MG Quirk last week, setting the tone for the new Signal<br>Intelligence Directorate (SID) leadership team's first group meeting. There is an almost entirely<br>new ensemble at the upper echelon of the SID, and they are new not only to the workforce, but<br>to each other--at least in the roles they now occupy. Energy was high as the individuals got to<br>know one another, began to form as a unified team, and addressed the business of SID.<br>(U//FOUO) SID leadership wants to create an atmosphere where magic can happen by<br>harnessing the power of SID's greatest asset: its workforce. Led by SID Director MG Richard<br>Quirk and Deputy Director Charlie Meals, the newly-appointed Deputy Directors <br>Jim Allen, and <br>, their Assistant Deputy Directors, Technical Directors, and other<br>SID leaders discussed how to "facilitate brilliance" by eliminating impediments in the way of<br>accomplishing SID's mission. All agreed that leadership's primary responsibility is to empower<br>and engage the workforce and push decision-making down to the right levels. As MG Quirk<br>stated, "We need to start and end our decision-making process with what's best for the nation."<br>(U//FOUO) The leaders considered where SID is today and its future direction. The leadership<br>team agreed that a sound strategy and organizational structure is already in place and<br>delivering incredible results. As the new leadership team coalesces, their emphasis will be on<br>evolution, not revolution. The leadership team will build upon this initial meeting and continue<br>the steps they have taken toward building a responsive leadership team delivering consistent,<br>fair, and understandable guidance.<br>(U//FOUO) Two more leadership meetings are planned for the coming months. The leadership<br>team is united in their enthusiasm for the SIGINT mission and overcoming the challenges that<br>lie ahead.
