DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) Post-war Iraq Plan<br>FROM: Iraq Issue Managers<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 04/11/2003<br><br>(TS//SI) At a time when much of the workforce is focused on enabling a successful outcome for<br>coalition forces in Iraq, a small team of experts is developing the post-war Iraq plan. As complex<br>and demanding as the combat environment will be, the transition to peace; the elimination of<br>Iraq's ability to threaten the U.S. and its allies; and the restoration of a civil government will<br>likely be the longest and potentially most demanding engagement in this campaign. This period,<br>known as Phase IV in formal planning documents, will present a host of new challenges and<br>opportunities for the cryptologic system. Although Phase IV was viewed as formally beginning<br>when major combat operations end, our interaction with CENTCOM, Pentagon and State<br>Department planners indicates that elements of Phase IV are already underway.<br>(TS//SI) In Phase IV we are confronted with a multitude of challenges. They include:<br>Sustaining force protection;<br>Maintaining domestic security;<br>Monitoring humanitarian programs;<br>Watching for efforts to undermine the nascent Iraqi government;<br>Delivering a comprehensive perspective on regional views and reactions;<br>Uncovering Iraqi war criminals;<br>Tracking the disposition of weapons and materiel no longer under Iraqi military control<br>We will execute our mission in an environment complicated by much broader international<br>participation than what we experienced in the war. We will face demands for sharing<br>communications security technology, intelligence information and resources in a unique multinational environment.<br>(TS//SI) Our team has already established contact with officials who will lead the transition<br>efforts in Phase IV. Developing an early understanding of the customer requirements for Phase<br>IV and establishing a relationship with those customers will allow us to affect the necessary<br>planning to optimize our posture and meet demands as they emerge. The sacrifice and cost that<br>will bring us to the end of the war must be honored by a commitment to ensure that Phase IV<br>sees a successful realization of long-term objectives, underpinned by solid cryptologic support.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
