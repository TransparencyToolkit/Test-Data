DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID Around the World: A TDY to Guantanamo Bay<br>FROM:<br>Customer Account Management (S112)<br>Run Date: 12/22/2003<br><br>(S//REL) An early start can have you climbing John Paul Jones Hill<br>to the Joint Task Force (JTF) SCIF while taking in a beautiful<br>sunrise over the Caribbean Sea with Camp Delta looming austerely<br>below on the southern coastline. After a hustled day of tackling a<br>myriad of issues and directly contributing to the global war on<br>terrorism, one might be inclined to drive out to Phillips Park and<br>enjoy a gorgeous sunset over Leeward Landing; however, the day<br>would not be complete without the frequent iguana encounter. Few<br>work environments offer such an opportunity - a rewarding<br>challenge with incredible surroundings.<br>(S//REL) The mission of JTF-GTMO is to conduct detention and<br>interrogation operations to collect and exploit intelligence in<br>support of the global war on terrorism (GWOT), to screen<br>detainees, and to support law enforcement and war crimes<br>investigations. The NSA Liaison Officer (NSA LNO) works in the<br>Joint Interrogation Group (JIG), a major element of JTF-GTMO. The<br>interrogation focus at Guantanamo is strategic; tactical questioning<br>is accomplished in-theater to see what they know, categorize them<br>accordingly, and determine what requirements they can satisfy.<br>(S) The work can be extremely interesting, challenging and very<br>fulfilling. On a given week, the NSA LNO might pull together<br>intelligence to support an upcoming interrogation, formulate<br>questions and strategies for the interrogation, and observe or<br>participate in the interrogation. Afterward, the LNO captures and<br>disseminates pertinent technical information gleaned from the<br>interrogation back to NSA TOPIs for SIGINT development.<br>(U//FOUO) Outside work, fun awaits and opportunities abound.<br>Water sports are outstanding: boating, paddling, fishing, water<br>skiing and boarding, sailing, swimming, snorkeling, and SCUBA. No<br>experience, no problem. Learn how to operate a boat in a weekend,<br>become a certified open water scuba diver within weeks. If you've<br>already mastered these skills, or once you do, the MWR marina<br>rents boats from pontoon party boats to Carolina skiffs to ski boats<br>to kayaks...and recently they've added sailboat rentals, too. The<br>local dive shop has all the gear and tips to ensure a perfect outing.<br>Surround all this water fun with a Tiki Bar and a Jerk House as well<br>as the Bayview Restaurant ... relaxing is easy.<br>(U//FOUO) Water sports not your cup of tea? There are many<br>other activities to round your day off. The library has two dozen<br>internet terminals and over 1000 videos. Or take in a movie at the<br>outdoor theatre featuring a weekly variety of the latest releases.<br>Other activities include: pottery, hiking, nature walks, biking,<br>paintball, martial arts, tennis, racquetball, basketball, softball, and<br>bowling. There are also several swimming pools and gyms. Or, just<br>relax and take in the warmth of the sun.<br>(U//FOUO) If you would be interested in a TDY opportunity at<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.
