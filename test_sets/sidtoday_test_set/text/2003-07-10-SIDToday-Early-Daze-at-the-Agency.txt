DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Early Daze at the Agency<br>FROM: A Staffer Who (Understandably) Wishes To Remain Anonymous<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 07/10/2003<br><br>(U) For some of us, it's been quite a while since we walked through the gatehouse for the first<br>time and were exposed to a strange new language: NSA jargon. Sometimes this process unfolds<br>gradually, as you pick up a bit of terminology here and there. At other times, there are spikes of<br>enlightenment...<br>(C) In preparation for my first job at the Agency, I was sent to a class on transcription. This<br>class involved listening to various foreign language conversations on reel-to-reel tapes and<br>writing down what was said. When I was handed some tapes, I noticed that "SECRET SPOKE"<br>was stamped on them in bold lettering. "Hmm," I thought, "that must mean the conversations<br>are secret, but why do they say 'SPOKE' instead of 'SPOKEN'? And if I write them down, do I<br>have to change the classification to 'SECRET WRITTEN, er.. WROTE'??"<br>(U//FOUO) Fast forward a few months. By now I was settled into my first office and knew<br>everything... almost. My deputy branch chief swung by my desk one day to report that he had<br>attended a division meeting in which he'd learned that the watch was a little shorthanded. "But<br>don't worry, I don't think you'll be drafted," he said before disappearing. To me, this was a nonsequitur. Drafted? Was there some fine print saying that when you are hired by the DOD that<br>you become eligible for a military draft?? My team chief set me straight.<br>(U) A final anecdote. Not long after, the same deputy branch chief mentioned to me that he<br>thought I had a pretty good chance of being promoted, maybe next year. "Holy cow!" I thought.<br>Promoted! As in, I'm going to be bossing people around only 18 months after setting foot inside<br>the building? Again, my team chief came to the rescue: think of it as a raise.<br>(U//FOUO) Note: The term "SPOKE" was a COMINT codeword and didn't signify in any way that<br>the material was oral. See a related memo phasing out this and other codewords. Also, being<br>"drafted" meant that one was asked to work shiftwork in a watch operation.<br>(U) Did you have any misunderstandings when you were a new hire?
