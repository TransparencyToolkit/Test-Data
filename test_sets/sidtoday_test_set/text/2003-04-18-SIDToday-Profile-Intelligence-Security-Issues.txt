"Is this a Cryptologic<br>Insecurity? What is a Cryptologic Insecurity?"<br><br>(S//SI) A Cryptologic Insecurity (CI) is when intelligence is<br>disclosed--such as via a media leak--without authorization. SID has<br>an office that handles its CI Program: the Intelligence Security<br>Issues office. Every day we scan approximately 350 press items for<br>potential CIs. We then research databases to confirm or deny the<br>validity of the CI. This is a vital step in the CI analysis process to<br>determine whether or not to forward the package to NSA's Public<br>Affairs Office (PAO) for tasking. What about SIGINT losses? We<br>review books and Internet articles to discover and document these<br>losses.<br><br>1.  Profiles: SID<br>Communications and<br>Support Operations<br>2.

Profile: Intelligence<br>Security Issues<br><br>(S//SI) Intelligence Security Issues also maintains the FIRSTFRUIT<br>Foreign Knowledge Database, which currently contains over 5,000<br>insecurity-related records. This is a SIGINT database that is the<br>Intelligence Community's prototype. FIRSTFRUIT combines all<br>SIGINT-related information--Espionage Damage Assessments,<br>Cryptologic Insecurities (Media/Books, etc.), Unauthorized<br>Disclosures, Demarches, and Liaison exchanges--into one<br>database.<br>(U//FOUO) We also are responsible for the SIGINT Director's staff<br>portion of the NSA Countering Adversary Denial and Deception<br>(D&amp;D;) Program, proactively protecting U.S. intelligence sources<br>and methods and determining ways to counter foreign denial and<br>deception. Our findings are published in D&amp;D; assessments and<br>respond to D&amp;D; questions from the Intelligence Community.<br>Finally, Intelligence Security Issues manages SID's Operations<br>Security (OPSEC) Program. We meet with SID OPSEC coordinators<br>to review the program and provide OPSEC training and guidance;<br>monitor the conduct of OPSEC within the SIGINT Directorate; and<br>submit appropriate NSA-required OPSEC reports.<br>(U//FOUO) This is just a brief overview of what Intelligence<br>Security Issues does every day.
