DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) The SID Leadership Offsite<br>FROM:<br>Chief SID Communications<br>Run Date: 06/06/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Maintaining a strong focus on tightening the bonds of the SIGINT Directorate<br>Leadership Team, MG Quirk led the next step toward SID Enterprise integration during the<br>group's second offsite held early this week. "We need to optimize the current SID strategy and<br>structure through full integration," stated MG Quirk as he opened the session. The newly<br>appointed leadership team then took advantage of the opportunity to further their team<br>cohesiveness by performing a thorough analysis of SID's mission through a collective look at<br>SID's roles and responsibilities.<br>(U//FOUO) An atmosphere of close collaboration and honest communication was evident<br>throughout the 2-day session as the process of reviewing SID's mission authorities led to frank<br>discussions of pressing SID issues. Two vital concerns repeatedly expressed were the need for<br>teamwork to resonate throughout the organization, and the importance of aligning ourselves as<br>corporate citizens. In other words, good, productive working relationships are necessary at all<br>levels within SID, with our Extended Enterprise, and with our corporate enablers.<br>(U) A continuing theme with this leadership team is to decentralize decision-making. One of their<br>goals is establishing a leadership style that "...removes the obstacles and gets out of the way to<br>let the people do their work." One important decision made was not to reorganize-the focus is<br>on honing the present organization into a more efficient contributor to America's security.<br>(U//FOUO) While there were no specific deliverables from this meeting, additional SID<br>Leadership sessions will be scheduled in the near future to continue the momentum begun in<br>the first two off-sites. To learn about the first off-site, go to<br> . Future agendas will include<br>expanding the roles of the Technical Directors, laying out SID governance, integrating as an<br>Extended Enterprise, and aligning with corporate enablers.
