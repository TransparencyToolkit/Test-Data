DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID's Approach to Uncommon Languages<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/22/2003<br><br>(C) Are you in need of a Fuzhou-English Dictionary? How about a Haitian Creole-English<br>Dictionary? Have you always wanted to investigate what it would take to learn the Kazakh<br>language? This is just a small sampling of the myriad language working aids that Project<br>Schoolbag makes available to NSA linguists. Project Schoolbag has its origins all the way back to<br>1964. Managed by the Senior Language Authority (SLA) Office, it is the SIGINT Directorate's<br>primary source for applied linguistic research. To date, over 100 books (dictionaries, glossaries,<br>grammars and textbooks) on over 60 languages have been published as a result of this<br>research.<br>(C) The SLA also sponsors the Strategic Strongholds in Less Commonly Taught Languages<br>(LCTLs) Program. This program replaces the Current Operational Language Reserve (COLR) and<br>the Contingent Language Acquisition and Maintenance Subprogram (CLAMS). LCTL emphasizes<br>proficiency at Level 3 and higher; previous programs targeted Level 2.<br>(C) Another difference between Strategic Strongholds and previous programs is that Strategic<br>Stronghold member language analysts are offered up to four weeks of training and/or work<br>experiences per year, instead of two weeks in the old program. The program aims for training 35 language analysts per Stronghold - an improvement over the 1-2 analysts we had in many<br>languages in the past.<br>(U//FOUO) If you would like to learn more, see the LCTLs webpage .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
