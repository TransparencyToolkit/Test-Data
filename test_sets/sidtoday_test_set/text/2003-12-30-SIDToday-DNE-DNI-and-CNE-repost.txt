DNI is the resultant intelligence that DNE produces.<br>(TS//SI) Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) - Active or "end-point" collection, which<br>involves the surreptitious infiltration and mastery of computers and other<br>network components. Once a device or network has been infiltrated, data of interest<br>can be extracted directly or the targeted system's operation can be modified to facilitate<br>mid-point collection (for instance, by covertly tagging data of interest, rerouting data<br>along accessible links, subtly weakening encryption, etc.).<br>(TS//SI) DNE is independent of the type of access: the collection can either be end-point or midpoint, active or passive, may (or may not) use CNE methods/techniques. Collection is not<br>limited to a computer; it can be against any system or device in the digital environment.<br>(S//SI) As our targets continue to migrate toward communications that use the digital global<br>network, DNE increasingly becomes the center of our SIGINT business. This is evidenced by<br>approximately half of our current SID Strategic Objectives directly addressing our need to<br>improve DNE. The 3 V's (volume, velocity, variety) present tremendous challenges in DNE. Our<br>targets are moving from fixed narrowband transmissions to shared, re-routable, extremely<br>wideband, multiplexed, multi-formatted transmissions. Each day, new types of protocols and<br>application formats appear in our targets' communications. Finally, our targets communications<br>are increasingly buried by millions of non-target communications.<br>(TS//SI) The primary focus of SID's recent transformation efforts is to improve our DNE.<br>Fortunately, the business of DNE has some great opportunities for improvement. The fact there<br>is a global network allows the concept of CNE collection. This allows us to actively hunt the<br>target instead of sifting through the chaff. Also, most communications on the global network<br>include some set of labels about the source, destination and path of the information. This<br>labeling supports new SIGINT development methodology. Using DNE, with the improved<br>labeling, we can quickly map the social, logical and physical networks of our target space.<br>Finally, the continued growth of standards and their widespread use in the global network will<br>allow us to use Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tools to portray the communications exactly<br>the same way the target sees it.<br>(S) In conclusion, DNE is an on-going challenge that has already produced extremely valuable<br>intelligence with great continued promise. Through the coming months and years, we will<br>accelerate our exploitation of DNI and track targets through their migration onto the global<br>network.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
