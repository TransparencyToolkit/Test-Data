DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) Third North Korea Rock Drill Breaks New Ground<br>FROM: the North Korea Issue Management Team (IMT)<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 12/02/2003<br><br>(S//SI) An article in today's NSA Daily discusses North Korea Rock Drill 3, held from 12 to 14<br>November. Further detail is provided below:<br>(S//SI) What made Rock Drill 3 especially unique was the fact that the primary "operator" being<br>supported was a non-military entity - the U.S. State Department. Developing a Cryptologic<br>Support Plan (CSP) for a non-military operator was a first for NSA/CSS and thus created a rich<br>learning opportunity for everyone involved. One of the first lessons learned was that unlike<br>military commands, the State Department does not develop Operations Plans (OPLAN) with<br>clearly outlined goals and objectives. The dynamic nature of their negotiations and planning<br>precludes such detailed documentation. Through close collaboration with State Department's<br>East Asia/Pacific and INR (Intelligence and Research) bureaus, the NK IMT gained an<br>understanding of State Department's objectives vis-Ãƒ -vis North Korea and used that<br>understanding as the basis for building a CSP. The lack of an existing OPLAN, however, soon led<br>to the coining of a new term, "Cryptologic Support Strategy," to distinguish it from a traditional<br>CSP.<br>(S//SI) The first day of Rock Drill 3 focused on a review of the draft Cryptologic Support Strategy<br>(CSS). The participants provided significant input, propelling the CSS to an eighty percent<br>completion point, while providing valuable suggestions on how to bring the CSS to completion.<br>On the second and third days of the Rock Drill, participants were led through a series of six<br>scenarios, crafted to elicit State Department views on likely responses to a wide range of North<br>Korean behaviors and to test the Cryptologic system's ability to respond. The energy and<br>enthusiasm sparked by the review of scenarios was palpable and afforded much greater insight<br>into the State Department's plans as well as into NSA/CSS capabilities to support them.<br>(S//SI) By all accounts Rock Drill 3 was a great success with many tangible results:<br>The first Cryptologic Support Strategy (80% complete) for a non-military entity;<br>Greater visibility into the State Department's decision space vis-a-vis North Korea;<br>A deeper appreciation of the interdependencies of each of the operators in North Korea (State<br>Department, USFK and PACOM) and an increased understanding of their objectives;<br>A better understanding of NSA/CSS capabilities to respond to State Department needs and<br>identification of steps to improve the overall posture;<br>State Department commitment to continual collaboration with NSA/CSS on plans and<br>intentions in order to optimize the SIGINT system;<br>And, finally, the stated desire of DIA participants to run multi-int ROCK DRILLs focused on<br>North Korea after participating in ours.<br>(U//FOUO) Maintaining the momentum, the Korea IMT is currently developing plans for ROCK<br>DRILL 4 in mid to late January 2004.
