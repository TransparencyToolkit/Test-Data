On the other hand, diagnosing a<br>cryptographic system can prove to be a very rewarding experience.<br>Achieving success is neither instantaneous nor deterministic. A<br>successful diagnosis may evolve over the course of months or<br>perhaps years. The diagnostic process may be undertaken by new<br>cryptanalysts and it may be revisited.
