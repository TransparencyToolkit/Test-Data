DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) How SIGINT's Done Down Under!<br>FROM:<br>Acting CDO for Australia<br>Run Date: 08/28/2003<br><br>(S//SI) "G'day mate" is the hearty greeting from NSA's Australian<br>counterpart, the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD), where it's<br>already tomorrow. NSA's partnership with DSD is rich in history,<br>cooperation, coordination, and value. At over 1100 strong, DSD's<br>mixed civilian-military workforce brings much SIGINT muscle to<br>the partnership - with DSD handling all reporting responsibility for<br>several specific targets, including Indonesia, Singapore, and<br>Malaysia. In the wake of September 11th, DSD, like NSA's other<br>Second Party partners, stepped in to carry more of the SIGINT<br>load, thus freeing additional NSA resources to focus on the global<br>war against terrorism.<br>(S//SI) During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the joint DSD-NSA facility<br>at Alice Springs contributed valuable intelligence in support of<br>combined operations in Iraq, which included Australian forces. As<br>the bombing in Bali in October 2002 and the recent bombing in<br>Jakarta demonstrate, terrorism is an issue in DSD's own backyard<br>as well and the cooperation between NSA and DSD<br>counterterrorism offices is close, continuing, and interdependent.<br>(S//SI) DSD's varied collection capabilities, including overhead,<br>satellite, and special collection sites, provide valuable accesses not<br>otherwise available to satisfy U.S. intelligence requirements. In<br>fact, over 15% of DSD's annual budget is spent directly in support<br>of U.S. intelligence requirements. Recently, members of the House<br>Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence visited Australia to<br>see first-hand the value of the intelligence relationship and express<br>our nation's thanks for Australia's support. Future prospects for<br>expanding the NSA-DSD SIGINT relationship include computer<br>network exploitation, close access, hard targets, special collection,<br>and divisions of effort on regional targets. Planning is currently<br>underway for the annual NSA-DSD bilateral conference, of which<br>SIGINT issues are a large part.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Second Party<br>SIGINT Cooperation<br>1.

Several Australian<br>integrees populate NSA offices and NSA employees are integrated<br>at DSD as well. Approximately 50% of the personnel at the joint<br>DSD-NSA facility at Alice Springs are NSA employees and<br>Australians are integrated throughout the wider SIGINT enterprise,<br>providing for a lively and beneficial exchange of SIGINT ideas,<br>products, and services.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
