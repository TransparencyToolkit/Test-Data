In that article we mentioned<br>the SIGINT on Demand (SOD) product as one of the first deliverables under the JOURNEYMAN<br>umbrella. The Customer Relationships Directorate's (CRD) Customer Response office has<br>another initiative--called CATAPULT--underway that also will be folded into JOURNEYMAN.<br>(C//SI) CATAPULT is a joint project between NSA and Canada's SIGINT organization, the<br>Communications Security Establishment (CSE), to prototype a data portal for exchanging<br>SIGINT product between NSA and its 2nd Party Partners. The CATAPULT data portal contains all<br>2nd Party viewable product shared with CSE to include multimedia reporting, CRITICOMM<br>released product, and SIGINT on Demand (SOD) items. CATAPULT--based on SLINGSHOT, a<br>CSE project that provides a similar capability--is implemented at CSE and is accessible from<br>NSANet via a browser interface.<br>(C//SI) As part of its efforts, the Joint End Product Planning Group (JEPPG) is sponsoring an<br>initiative to establish an XML standard for the exchange of 2nd Party multimedia product,<br>eliminating the need for any additional automated or manual formatting. In February, we began<br>the exchange of XML-formatted SOD product and metadata for inclusion in CATAPULT and<br>SLINGSHOT--a step up from the text-only email format that was used before. The lessons<br>learned from our experience with CSE on the CATAPULT prototype are being applied to data<br>exchanges with our other 2nd Party partners, as well. In April, Customer Response began<br>forwarding XML formatted SOD product and metadata to the United Kingdom's SIGINT<br>organization Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).<br>(S//SI) In March, over fifty NSA personnel--drawn from the China/Korea product line,<br>TRAILBLAZER Target Operational Pilot (TOP), and Customer Response organizations--began<br>attending half-day training sessions on "CATAPULT Basics." Customer Response continues to<br>identify additional analysts as CATAPULT users; the current configuration can accommodate 200<br>simultaneous users. During a period extending through April, users will evaluate CATAPULT and<br>generate additional multimedia requirements for the broader JOURNEYMAN program.<br>(C//SI) For additional information on CATAPULT and the exchange of multimedia product with<br>our 2nd Party partners, contact<br>, Customer Response/Delivery Techniques,<br>, <br>@nsa.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
