Their aim<br>was to promote an interest in international events and affairs while<br>providing unique insights into those issues. That mission continues<br>today, as the IAI routinely hosts speakers from classified and<br>unclassified arenas to lecture on hot topics in international affairs<br>and encourages its members to write and publish papers on related<br>subjects.<br>(U//FOUO) The IAI employs many methods of raising awareness of<br>international affairs. These include annual events such as the<br>International Challenge, which tests members and non-members<br>on their international affairs trivia, a book sale featuring the latest<br>and greatest in international affairs literature, and an essay contest<br>covering a range of subjects. All of these endeavors are well<br>received by employees and many also include cash prizes for the<br>winners!<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) NSA's Learned<br>Organizations<br>1.

An intern sits on the<br>IAI Board, and the organization has recently instituted a new policy<br>granting membership to all IA Intern new-hires, free of charge for<br>their first year. This recruitment tool has been very successful, and<br>has prompted IAI to reach out to the other skill-field communities<br>with a similar membership agreement offer.<br>(U//FOUO) The International Affairs Institute has been reaching<br>out to the workforce for over 30 years, hosting hundreds of<br>speakers and lectures and publishing numerous papers on<br>international issues.
