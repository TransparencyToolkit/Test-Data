Once a person becomes accustomed to hearing the jargon, it becomes<br>second nature - but an outsider sitting in on a typical SID meeting would likely have no idea<br>what's going on! We thought it would be interesting to document some of this "SID jargon" we'll start by looking at the vocabulary of one of the core SIGINT professions: transcription.<br>(U//FOUO) Transcription is sometimes confused with translation. What's the difference? When<br>you are translating, you take something (written or oral) in one language and convert it into<br>another. Transcription, on the other hand, is when a person listens to a person talking and writes<br>down (in the original language) what was said. Sounds easy? It isn't! Aside from the fact that<br>the sound quality may not be the greatest, there's the need to be proficient in a foreign<br>language, not to mention that the speakers may have dialects, quirks of speech, use unfamiliar<br>slang, etc.<br>(U//FOUO) Here's a list of commonly used transcription terms. It may give some insight into<br>what it's like to be a transcriber (or "scribe" for short)!:<br>"foot pedal" : a device used to allow the scribe to back up, play, fast forward, etc. a<br>recording using his feet, thereby freeing up the hands for typing.<br>"rock on it" : the act of listening to a certain garbled word over and over to try to figure out<br>what is being said.<br>"A%" (called A-value or simply A-val): a marking used by a scribe to note "I am positive<br>that's what's being said." This contrasts with "B%", which means, "I think that's what's being<br>said," or "C%" which means, "That's what it sounds like, but I can't nail down what the word is."<br>In a transcript, such a term might appear something like this: "Mr. Smith(B%) said he was the<br>director of the newly-formed company."<br>"read" : this is a scale indicating how clear a recording is. A read of 1 indicates that there is<br>nothing intelligible. A read of 5 (the highest, called "5-by") means near perfect audio quality.<br>You might hear a scribe say, "This read of 2 is terrible! I can only pick out a word here and<br>there!"<br>"a cut" : a recorded conversation. "There was nothing to report on the first three cuts, but<br>the reporters will want us to work on the fourth cut asap, as a VIP was speaking!"<br>"voice id" : when a scribe knows a speaker's voice so well that he can identify the person on<br>that basis alone. "The caller didn't say his name, but the senior scribe knew the voice well<br>enough to do a voice id on the person: it was Mr. Jones."<br>"ears" : a scribe's earphones. "Put on your ears and come listen to this cut."<br>"ui fem" : an unidentified female. "A ui fem came on the line and asked to speak to the<br>operator." The counterpart to this is "ui male".<br>"scan" : to listen quickly through a recording to determine whether or not it merits<br>transcription.<br>"a gist" : when a scribe summarizes in English what was said in a conversation. "It was very<br>long and complicated, so I did a gist to explain what was happening."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"qc" : quality control. An experienced scribe usually qc's the work of a beginner to check for<br>accuracy.<br>"ntr" : nothing to report.<br>"1-2G" : one or two words are garbled. "XG" means an indeterminate number of words are<br>garbled. Likewise, "1-2M" means "1 or 2 words missing."<br>"reverse dictionary" : a working aid that lists the words of a language alphabetically starting<br>with the last letter and working towards the first letter. (So in the Latin alphabet, words ending<br>in "a"- rather than those starting with "a" - would be at the front of the reverse dictionary.) This<br>is used when the first part of a word is garbled or indistinct, but the end is clear. Let's say a<br>scribe hears "....partment". He can refer to the reverse dictionary to search for a word that<br>would make sense in the context of the sentence (e.g. com partment, de partment, etc.)<br>"a false friend" : a foreign language word that is similar to an English word, but has a<br>different meaning.<br>(U//FOUO) Do you work in a profession with unique jargon? We'd very much like to publish<br>similar lists for other skill fields - sound out your peers for some terms and make a list! We look<br>forward to hearing from you.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
