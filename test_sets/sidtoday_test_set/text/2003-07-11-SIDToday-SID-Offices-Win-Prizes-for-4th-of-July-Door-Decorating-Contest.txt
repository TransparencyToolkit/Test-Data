DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Offices Win Prizes for 4th of July Door Decorating Contest<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 07/11/2003<br><br>(U) Recently, two SID offices were awarded first prize for the 4th of July Door Decoration<br>Contest (click HERE for a listing of the winners). The photos (view "Full Article" to see) show two<br>of these doors: "Proof That Our Flag Was Still There" and "Star Spangled Agency". Here is the<br>background on one of these:<br>Proof That Our Flag Was Still There... And Always Will Be! Rm: 1C166<br>By: <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>(U) The theme "Proof That Our Flag Was Still There" came easily to us. Everywhere you look,<br>the proof is there. You see it on clothes, outside houses, on cars, in gardens, in businesses, in<br>magazines, on TV, in movies, and for the last week, you can see the proof on the door to our<br>office: the SID Senior Enlisted Advisor's office. Our office takes care of the 4000-billeted military<br>members who work in SID. Our office is one of the first offices new military members come to<br>when they arrive at the NSA. From there, we track our military when they are deployed, moving<br>offices, and when they retire or leave here to go to a new duty station. It may be 30 years in the<br>military or four, but seeing them fulfill a career like that is proof enough that our flag is still<br>there.<br>(U) Developing the theme was easy. We had been collecting pictures and articles since the<br>September 11th tragedy. We became an office the week of the tragedy. We were four offices<br>that had never worked together merging into one that week. Like many Americans, the tragedy<br>brought us all closer together. When we heard about the Independence Day door contest, we<br>knew we had to do a door. We gathered all of the old photographs we had been collecting and<br>began finding new pictures of other events that affected our great country. We also had to<br>remember our fallen who had died serving and defending it. For weeks, we searched for anything<br>that we thought was a good representation of why our flag is still there. We also know that our<br>country isn't here just because of the military; even though we defend our country with our<br>lives, we know that civilians play a major part as well. At the Agency we see this daily, even if<br>America doesn't. We wanted people old and young and of every race represented on our door;<br>just like our office and just like America.<br>(U) Patriotism should come easy. It's pride in what you believe in as well as love. We love our<br>country and what it represents. Our office is proud we see what our military does to defend it-when we get a bright 19-year-old, ready to serve, checking into our office to start work, or a<br>47-year-old ready to retire. We are confident our flag will always be there.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
