DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) NIPF--What Is It and What Does It MEAN for Intelligence<br>Community Priorities?<br>FROM:<br>NSA Representative to NIPF Working Group<br>Run Date: 04/17/2003<br>(U//FOUO) On 24 February, President Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive<br>(NSPD-26) entitled "Intelligence Priorities," which completely overhauled the intelligence priority<br>process. The directive created a process that is much more dynamic and better able to keep<br>pace with the demands placed on the Intelligence Community (IC). The new process is called<br>the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) and contains a matrix which links<br>intelligence issues to specific geographic targets or organizations.<br>(U//FOUO) The Assistant Director for Central Intelligence for Analysis and Production (ADCI/AP),<br>Mark Lowenthal, will be responsible for implementing this new process, and to facilitate the<br>transition within SID, Mark Roth from that office, will be briefing the new process in Friedman<br>Auditorium on 23 April from 0830-1000. We invite all US citizens to attend and hear first-hand<br>how this new requirements process will be implemented across the IC. Specific items to be<br>covered in the briefing include but are not limited to the evolution of the priority process, an<br>explanation of NIPF, the transition from the old PDD-35 process, and the impact on NSA and the<br>entire intelligence community as we move to a more flexible, Intelligence Needs (IN) driven<br>system.<br>(U//FOUO) Following Mark's presentation, a Q &amp; A session with<br> (NSA representative<br>to NIAPB and NICB), <br> NSA representative to NIPF working group,<br>, Chief Customer Gateway, <br> Acting Chief of Requirements Analysis<br>Center, <br> Chief of Information Needs Division, and <br>, Acting Chairman of<br>the SIGINT Requirements and Evaluations Sub-Committee (SIRVES), will be held.<br>(U//FOUO) The rollout of NIPF is an important time for the IC. This new process is a synthesis of<br>methods used in the past and will go a long way towards helping the Community address the<br>increasing and ever changing demands placed upon it. Please plan to attend this important<br>session to learn about changes in the community priorities system and their impact on NSA!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
