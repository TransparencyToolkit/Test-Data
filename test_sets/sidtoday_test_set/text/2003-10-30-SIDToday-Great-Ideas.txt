DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Great Ideas<br>FROM:<br>SIGINT Communications<br>Run Date: 10/30/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) A couple of weeks ago, Charles Berlin, the SID Chief of Staff, and the Deputy<br>Directorate Chiefs of Staff selected two ideas for implementation for the new SID Ideas<br>program . The selection was difficult, but the decision criteria was based on ability to<br>successfully implement and likelihood to positively affect the largest group of SID employees.<br>The two ideas that were selected were:<br>1.  A networking web page for new direct hires<br>2.  Plain language supplements to complex legal documents such as E.O. 12333, NSD 42,<br>and the Computer Security Act of 1987<br>(U//FOUO) Both of these ideas have the ability to provide long-term positive results to a large<br>group of people. Every Agency employee was once a new employee, and all of us should be able<br>to remember how overwhelming this place can be at first. The idea to provide an immediate<br>networking base for new hires mirrors an already successful tool implemented by the Intern<br>Program administrators. This idea allows direct hires to reap the same benefits. The plain<br>language supplements to legal documents will affect every SID employee because we all have to<br>sign them, and the complex legalese often prevents employees from fully comprehending the<br>agreements they are signing. With plain language supplements, employees will be able to feel<br>more comfortable about the commitments they are making.<br>(U//FOUO) Both of these projects are in the beginning stages of implementation. We look<br>forward to continuing with this process, and to evaluating its success in the aftermath of the<br>implementation.<br>(U//FOUO) A new set of ideas will soon be presented to the Chiefs of Staff, so send in your<br>ideas! Let us know what you think! The more ideas, the merrier!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
