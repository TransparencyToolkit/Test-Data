DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) PATENTHAMMER<br>FROM:<br>, USAF<br>Chief, National Tactical Integration Office<br>Run Date: 06/11/2003<br><br>(S//SI) After 9/11, the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) identified a major gap in its<br>threat warning coverage against terrorist cellular, fax, and pager communications. They needed<br>help, and the Customer Relationships Directorate's National Tactical Integration Office (NTIO)<br>responded. The NTIO provided a portable, advanced signal collection system with a remote,<br>reach-back capability to Special Operations Forces and Navy SEALs deploying to Kosovo,<br>Georgia, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the Philippines. This system, PATENTHAMMER,<br>was already in development as a National Tactical Integration (NTI) proof-of-concept to<br>demonstrate reach-forward/ reach-back operations and to promote technology insertion into<br>tactical SIGINT capabilities.<br>(U) What Does "Reach Forward" and "Reach Back" Mean?<br>(U) Reach-forward capabilities enable personnel in surface/ground and national facilities to<br>obtain current information from active collection assets. With this information, an analyst in an<br>intelligence center can fuse multiple data inputs to more effectively support cross-system<br>cueing, data correlation, or other intelligence functions.<br>(U) Reach-back capabilities allow active collection assets to "reach back" into databases of<br>surface/ground and national facilities to retrieve information that will assist them in satisfying<br>their operational tasking. For example, an airborne reconnaissance operator can obtain historical<br>data (reach back) as well as current information (reach forward) on a target of interest that<br>other sensors covering the same operational theater provide.<br>(S) Army Incorporates PATENTHAMMER Technology Into its PROPHET System<br>(S) Based on successful PATENTHAMMER demonstrations, the Army has incorporated<br>PATENTHAMMER technology into PROPHET, its tactical SIGINT/Early Warning system. PROPHET<br>provides force protection by allowing the Brigade Commander to visualize his battle space.<br>Specifically, it provides:<br>relevant, time-critical actionable information such as reports of intercepted voice<br>communications and Lines of Bearing location data on target emitters.<br>early warning of potential threats in areas of operation, using collected SIGINT and<br>ground surveillance information.<br>(S) As a result of PATENTHAMMER technology, the Army is now able to provide SIGINT<br>capabilities against modern signals (e.g., cellular, fax, and pager) two years ahead of schedule.<br>Ten PATENTHAMMER systems-- consisting of collection radios with line-of-sight, DF, and MVSAT<br>communications packages-- were incorporated into PROPHET in support of Operation Iraqi<br>Freedom. The first four of these Army PROPHET-HAMMER systems have already been deployed<br>to units in the Baghdad, Mosul, and Tikrit areas of Iraq with the remaining six to follow this<br>summer.<br>(S//SI) Army Teams With GRSOC/PROPHET-HAMMER System Placed in GRSOC Cell<br>(S//SI) Army involvement in the PATENTHAMMER program led to a teaming effort with the Ft<br>Gordon Regional Security Operations Center (GRSOC) to place a PROPHET-HAMMER back-end<br>system in the GRSOC Tactical Cell. This summer, GRSOC will have direct connectivity to all<br>PROPHET-HAMMER systems deployed in Iraq. This will enable them to share data, tune<br>PROPHET-HAMMER receivers, listen to live voice intercepts, obtain DF information on signals,<br>and survey the signal spectrum.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(S) NTIO Teams With KRSOC/What the Future Holds/For More Information<br>(S//SI) The NTIO is working with the Kunia Regional Security Operations Center (KRSOC) on a<br>Joint Chiefs of Staff Special Projects Exercise to provide a similar NTI proof-of-concept capability<br>for reach-forward/reach-back operations in the Pacific. Assuming operations at GRSOC and<br>KSROC are successful, the next step will be to include this type of functionality as part of SID's<br>future Radio Frequency (RF) strategy for HF/UHF/VHF collection. The SIGINT capability of these<br>new advanced digital software radios can satisfy both National and Tactical SIGINT requirements<br>and has the potential to fill major gaps in the RF collection environment.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information on PATENTHAMMER and PROPHET, contact <br>,<br>, <br>@nsa.
