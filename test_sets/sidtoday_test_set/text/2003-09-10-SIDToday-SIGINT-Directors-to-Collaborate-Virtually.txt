DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SIGINT Directors to Collaborate Virtually<br>FROM:<br>Collaboration Project Manager<br>Run Date: 09/10/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) The Five-Eyes SIGINT Directors will soon be using a<br>new tool to enhance their collaboration on subjects ranging from<br>current intelligence objectives to future collection planning. The<br>tool, InfoWorkSpace (IWS), is a virtual collaborative network<br>accepted by DOD and the Intelligence Community as the standard<br>collaboration tool suite of choice. IWS will enable the directors to<br>communicate from their desktops using VTC, text chat, audio<br>conferencing, whiteboards, and shared view.<br>(U//FOUO) IWS Already in Use Among Five-Party<br>Workforces<br>(S//SI) NSA'ers and their Second Party counterparts at the<br>working levels are collaborating hourly via IWS on a number of key<br>topics including: Operation Enduring Freedom, international<br>terrorism, real-time collection coordination, SIGINT Development,<br>and multi-intelligence tasking. Five Party community managers and<br>analysts are taking advantage of this capability to save time,<br>establish stronger ties, and provide maximum support to<br>customers worldwide. Because of the successful use of IWS by<br>these members of the SIGINT community, the Joint Executive for<br>SIGINT Interoperability (JESI) has agreed that IWS should be<br>deployed to the Five-Eyes SIGINT leadership.<br>(U) SIGINT Directors To Gain Access<br>(U//FOUO) The SIGINT directors will be given access to one of the<br>IWS servers managed by NSA, the VOTEDOOR server. They will<br>have all of the IWS collaborative tools available to them on their<br>desktops to conduct business at the strategic level, just as over<br>four thousand members of their respective workforces have used it<br>for operational purposes. Ultimately, the personal interaction<br>among the directors that is so vital to our national interests and<br>those of our partners will be increased; strategic oversight of<br>operational issues will be facilitated; matters that require<br>consensus may be resolved expeditiously; and challenges can be<br>discussed in a collegial setting.<br>(U//FOUO) How To Get an IWS Account for Yourself<br>(U//FOUO) You may not be a senior decision maker and your<br>reason for choosing virtual collaboration may not directly respond<br>to a crisis, but your collaboration efforts are vital to strengthening<br>the SIGINT partnership. If you want to save time and resources no<br>matter what your objectives are, IWS can be the answer. The cost<br>of participating in IWS collaboration is minimal (a little time and<br>effort), while the potential benefits are limitless.
