DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID's Interactions with Congress: Part III - Communications and<br>Orgs (repost)<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Run Date: 12/29/2003<br>(U) Communications<br>(U) How Many Congressional Queries and Briefings Does SID LA Handle Per Month?<br>(U//FOUO) The number of queries from staffers varies. The busiest months are typically March,<br>April and May, because the staffers are reviewing the CBJB and preparing their budget mark<br>ups. This year, a total of 18, 40, and 23 RFIs were received during these months, respectively. A<br>large majority of the queries require a very quick turnaround during this time, and as it is LA's<br>opportunity to influence the mark ups, these requests are given focused attention.<br>(U//FOUO) Requests for briefings tend to be heaviest from Jan - May. Again, this is due to the<br>fact that staffers are preparing for their mark ups. This year, the number of staffer visits to SID<br>ranged from 12 to 16 per month during the period of March through May. These visits often<br>included multiple briefings.<br>(U) How Else Does SID LA Communicate With Congress?<br>(U//FOUO) In addition to budgeting issues, Congress is also responsible for general oversight of<br>NSA (and SID), to ensure we are doing our job competently and adhering to the law. As a result,<br>we keep the Congress informed of significant developments that may affect our performance<br>(positively or negatively). A vehicle for doing this is a "Congressional Notification". These range<br>from "bad news" reports-- such as power outages that have resulted in degradation of service or<br>security breaches at field stations-- to items of interest such as:<br>the NSA Off-site Language Processing Facility;<br>Global Network Analyst Intern Program;<br>change in SID leadership; and<br>new partnerships with Third Parties.<br>As such, notifications are a great way to keep Congress informed of good news as well as bad<br>news. They should hear it from us before they read it in the paper.<br>(U) How Does SID LA Communicate with the SID Workforce?<br>(U) Every Friday SID LA publishes a Weekly Congressional Update providing feedback on recent<br>congressional visits, highlighting upcoming visits and congressional travel. This update can be<br>found on the SID LA website . The updates are also available via the SID Notes/Reports<br>section of the SID Today homepage.<br>(U) Organizational Structure<br>(U) How Does SID LA Work With NSA's LAO?<br>(U//FOUO) SID LA provides congressional staffers and committees with appropriate SIGINTrelated information and briefings and develop the SID Congressional Engagement Strategy for<br>inclusion into the overall NSA Engagement Strategy. The office is not forward-deployed from<br>NSA LAO, but is actually assigned to SID and staffed by SIGINTers. It is structured similarly to<br>NSA LAO in that SID LA has separate "account managers" for the involved congressional<br>committees. Office personnel usually attend SID briefings to the congressional staffs and<br>committees and provide feedback on these sessions to SID leadership. They can then provide<br>background information as to the tone and context surrounding follow-on queries from<br>Congress.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U//FOUO) For further information on how NSA LAO interacts with Congress, see their web page<br>at "go lao".<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
