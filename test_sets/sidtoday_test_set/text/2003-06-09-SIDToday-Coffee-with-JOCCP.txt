Kennedy, USA, Major General James C. King, USA,<br>Brigadier General James A. Jaeger, USAF, and Brigadier General Neal Robinson, USAF all have in<br>common? They were graduates of the Junior Officer Cryptologic Career Program (JOCCP).<br>(U) The JOCCP was established in June 1971 by the DIRNSA, then Vice Admiral Noel Gaylor, to<br>develop the military's professional SIGINT officer cadre. The program offers participants a<br>unique 36-month opportunity to develop a broad technical and operational expertise through a<br>combination of academics and workcenter experience.<br>(U) The academic portion of JOCCP consists of over 1400 hours of coursework, taught by the<br>National Cryptologic School. These courses cover a wide range of technical subjects to prepare<br>the participants for their operational workcenter tours throughout NSA. Typically, each JOCCP<br>participant completes four workcenters, each normally six-months in length. While these<br>workcenters usually focus on the cryptologic effort at NSA, participants often deploy in support<br>of other intelligence agencies and major military commands, wherever the country's interests<br>are threatened. The program currently has 38 participants and has graduated 335 officers.<br>(U) To learn more about the JOCCP, click here or type 'go joccp'.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
