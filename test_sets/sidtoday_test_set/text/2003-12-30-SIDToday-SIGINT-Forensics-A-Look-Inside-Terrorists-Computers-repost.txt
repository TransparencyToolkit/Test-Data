DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) SIGINT Forensics: A Look Inside Terrorists' Computers<br>(repost)<br>FROM: Dr. Adele Merritt<br>SIGINT Forensics Lab<br>Run Date: 12/30/2003<br>(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: This article appeared on September 22nd.<br>(U//FOUO) Recently, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested 19 suspected Al Qaeda<br>members. The New York Times reported that the authorities "need to sift through 30 computer<br>hard drives" and it "could take weeks if not months" to finish gathering evidence. Ever since the<br>War on Terrorism started, government agencies throughout the world have been gathering<br>computer media while pursuing and capturing suspected terrorist and Al Qaeda members. Ever<br>wonder who looks at this data?<br>(S//SI) The SIGINT Forensics Lab was established in September 2001. The Lab's mission is to<br>analyze seized computer media in support of SIGINT operations. This makes the Lab unique<br>from other computer forensics efforts that exist throughout the U.S. Government. Utilizing<br>commercial, open source, and in-house developed tools, the Lab harvests communications<br>information such as phone numbers and e-mail addresses in an effort to provide actionable<br>SIGINT leads to NSA offices. Because the lead information is pulled from computer data, the Lab<br>is also usually able to pass along useful context information to assist customers in assessing the<br>significance of the lead. Residing in Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES), the Lab is<br>also well-positioned to identify and facilitate the exploitation of encryption and steganography<br>found in target computer data.<br>(S//SI) One other unique service provided by the SIGINT Forensics Lab is the identification of<br>direct and indirect communication links from looking across data from numerous target<br>computers collected via SIGINT, HUMINT, and law enforcement efforts. This problem is more<br>challenging than other metadata chaining efforts due to the variability of the communications<br>data format and locations within computer media. However, the Lab has been able to overcome<br>this problem and find countless communication connections between target computers. These<br>discoveries have led to the identification of new targets for the SIGINT system to pursue, as well<br>as providing a better understanding of how targets communicate via computers.<br>(S) In addition to providing SIGINT support, the lab also provides technical assistance to<br>external organizations through facilitating responses to requests for decryption of computer<br>data, as well as providing computer communication profiles for targets. On occasion, the lab has<br>also been able to provide non-communications forensics work. For instance, in November 2002,<br>pictures of American trains found on a terrorist hard drive prompted intelligence reports and a<br>FBI-issued alert warning that Al Qaeda operatives may be planning an attack against US<br>railroads. Time Magazine reported in their November 4, 2002 issue, "photos of American<br>passenger and cargo trains as well as rail crossings" were found on a terrorist hard drive. The<br>SIGINT Forensics Lab examined the photos and accompanying computer files to determine that<br>the train photos were taken from a 1980's commercially produced clip art CD. NSA was able to<br>provide this information to the various elements of the U.S. Government who had committed<br>resources to following this specific threat.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are interested in learning more about the SIGINT Forensics Lab, please contact<br>us at<br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
