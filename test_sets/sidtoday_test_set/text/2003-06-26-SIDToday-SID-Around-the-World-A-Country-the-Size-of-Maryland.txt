No, it's not<br>Switzerland. The answer: Belgium.<br>(U) So what are the three languages? French (spoken by the<br>Walloons in the southern half of the country), Flemish (a dialect of<br>Dutch-- spoken in the northern half), and a small area near the<br>German border where they speak... well, you know. (Plus,<br>Brussels, right in the middle, is bilingual.) When you mention<br>Belgium, people often give you a quizzical look. They don't have a<br>clear idea of what it's about. It's complicated!<br>(U) What's Belgium noted for? Well, for many people, food and<br>drink. The national dish is mussels and fries (pommes frites). You<br>know about the waffles. If you want to be popular, give someone<br>Belgian chocolates. And beer is the national drink (yes, even<br>among those who speak French). Belgian beers are unique-several varieties are brewed nowhere else in the world. A curiosity<br>is that Belgians often divide their beers into "good" and "evil". In<br>the former category you have Trappist ales (brewed by Trappist<br>monks) and beers named for numerous saints. In the latter, you<br>have such potions as "Piraat" (Pirate), and "Fin du Monde" (End of<br>the World).<br>(C) What is SID doing there in Belgium? Well, there are SID<br>representatives at NATO political headquarters in Brussels and at<br>NATO's military headquarters, based near Mons. (Some rue the<br>fact that years ago Charles De Gaulle had a falling out with NATO,<br>resulting in the HQ relocating from Paris in 1967.) In Mons, some<br>representatives work in an underground bunker. Administratively,<br>these people fall under NCEUR (NSA/CSS Europe, based in<br>Stuttgart, Germany).<br>(U) NATO, EU, Romance language, Germanic language... is<br>Belgium the cultural crossroads of Europe?<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.
