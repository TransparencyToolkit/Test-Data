DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Promotion Cycle Recap<br>FROM:<br>SID Workforce Performance Management Executive<br>Run Date: 04/08/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) We are now well into the FY03 promotion cycle. This year the Director has allocated<br>more money than in the past few years and has distributed promotion/QSI (quality step<br>increase) and award dollars at the same time to give managers a variety of ways to adjust top<br>performers' salaries. This takes us the next step toward compensation reform and will allow us<br>to adjust salaries in three ways-promotions, QSIs, and bonuses-all in the same time frame with<br>the same process. However, having said that, we need to again remind people of the facts - SID<br>has 5,324 people eligible for promotion, and we estimate that the dollar allocation will allow us<br>to promote about 700 people, or 1 in 8 of those eligible.<br>(U//FOUO) This pay adjustment process is a core leadership and management priority and<br>responsibility. Managers are to look at the potential people demonstrate and not just "what have<br>you done for me lately" performance. They are to look at the whole person - the skills, abilities,<br>attributes, and qualities people bring to their job performance and the demonstration of<br>adherence to the core SID values of integrity, loyalty, commitment, openness, respect, and<br>corporate mindedness. Remember that promotions are for outstanding performance, thus<br>adherence to the above principles, and the demonstration of potential to work at the next level.<br>(U//FOUO) We've built feedback into every level of this cycle. As decisions are made and names<br>are forwarded to the next level, people are to receive feedback about the results. No one be<br>surprised, either positively or negatively, on the day salary adjustments are announced. We will<br>perform spot checks on the process both to see if people are receiving feedback and to see if<br>the feedback is constructive and raise any issues to leadership for immediate resolution.<br>(U//FOUO) We will continue to provide communications throughout this process. In addition, this<br>information will all be posted on the SID Workforce Performance Management homepage .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
