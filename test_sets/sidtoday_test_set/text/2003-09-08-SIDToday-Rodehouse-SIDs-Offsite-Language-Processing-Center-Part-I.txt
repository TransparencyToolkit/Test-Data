The<br>conclusion will appear tomorrow.<br>(TS//SI) What happens when NSA suddenly needs to find more linguists to process a certain<br>language? It takes a long time to train a person in a language, and hiring native speakers has its<br>own difficulty: sometimes these linguists are not fully cleared. The Agency has faced this<br>problem a number of times over the years. The solution? To house these not-fully-cleared<br>linguists in a separate facility where appropriate security procedures can be put in place. Let's<br>take a look at how this idea has evolved...<br>(U) The Cold War<br>(TS//SI) Does the coverterm CLOISTER mean anything to you? If you began work at NSA after<br>1980, probably not. But in the 60's and 70's NSA had a language center in College Park, staffed<br>by contractor native speakers of Russian and Eastern European languages who worked under the<br>supervision of government managers. Language materials traveled up and down the Baltimore<br>Washington Parkway by secure courier, as these linguists churned out thousands of transcripts<br>in support of former A Group targets.<br>(U) Somalia<br>(TS//SI) Fast forward to 1993 and the crisis in Somali. During Operation Restore Hope, the<br>company BDM had an in-country contract with the Army to provide Somali language support. As<br>U.S. troops withdrew from Somalia, NSA contracted with BDM to employ Somali linguists here in<br>Maryland to transcribe intercept from a remote collection package, thus giving rise to the urban<br>legend of D.C taxi cab driver doing SIGINT. Because of their ties to their homeland, it was not<br>possible to fully clear these linguists quickly and bring them into NSA spaces. So a facility for the<br>linguists was opened in Columbia, Md., where they worked along with Army analysts and<br>reporters until 1995.<br>(U) Haiti and the Balkans<br>(TS//SI) The Haitian crisis of 1994 employed a similar model, using less-than-fully cleared<br>native speakers at the offsite facility. In 1995, a Serbo-Croatian mission was established at the<br>facility in support of the Balkans. This mission, however, differed significantly from the previous<br>two. Instead of transcribing from a single collector, the linguists worked as extensions of the<br>target offices, transcribing material from national collectors. In 1998, an Albanian mission was<br>added to the facility. At this point, the contract changed from BDM to PSC and moved from<br>Columbia to a small office in the Airport Square complex. Only the Balkans missions remained.<br>Then came 9/11.<br>(U//FOUO) Coming in part two: Rodehouse since 9/11 and future opportunities.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph"></p>
