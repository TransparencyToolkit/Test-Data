Nothing illustrates this better than the U.S.<br>United Nations (USUN) team which, from the outset, worked<br>tirelessly to strengthen the ties between NSA and USUN.<br>(S//SI) SIGINT support to USUN's diplomatic efforts concerning<br>Iraq has been exceptional. Timely SIGINT played a critical role in<br>the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolutions 1441<br>(strengthened the inspection regime and demanded Iraq disarm or<br>face serious consequences) and 1472 (revised the humanitarian<br>aid program for Iraq). During that period, the overall volume of<br>SIGINT supplied to USUN doubled, and the number of timely<br>SIGINT tippers delivered to USUN players during key points in the<br>negotiations increased by a factor of four. It was this effort that<br>prompted Ambassador Negroponte to thank NSA for its work and<br>to offer this unsolicited comment: "I can't imagine better<br>intelligence support for a diplomatic mission."<br>(S//SI) The enterprise-level relationships built by our partnerships<br>have matured from being transactional to relational in nature.<br>Instead of working toward customer satisfaction of individual<br>requirements, these components have developed a degree of<br>understanding of their customers' needs that promotes positive<br>outcomes on an even broader scale. The USUN Customer Support<br>Team worked hard to bring producers and customers closer<br>together to increase understanding between the USUN<br>ambassadors and political officers and NSA analysts and producers.<br>They are only a small part of a much larger team of collectors,<br>processors, enablers and analyst/reporters, whose outstanding<br>collective efforts often elicit admiration and praise from USUN<br>customers. High-quality, timely reporting, precisely tailored to the<br>customer's needs, has been key for USUN customer satisfaction;<br>and the people behind the service have made the difference.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Customer Relations<br>1.
