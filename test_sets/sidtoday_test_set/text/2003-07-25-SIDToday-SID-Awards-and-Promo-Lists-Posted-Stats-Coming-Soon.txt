DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID Awards and Promo Lists Posted; Stats Coming Soon<br>FROM:<br>Workforce Management Executive<br>Run Date: 07/25/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Now that the FY03 promotion cycle is over, we would like to catch you up on a few<br>things. As you know, this year's process was broader than promotions-- it also included a range<br>of rewards for excellence performance, including QSIs (Quality Step Increases), SSWPs<br>(Sustained Superior Work Performance), SAAs (Individual Cash Awards) and SABs (Team Cash<br>Awards). In reality, it would be better to now call the process a "pay adjustment" process that<br>will lead us eventually to compensation reform.<br>(U//FOUO) This year, for the first time, we posted both the SID FY03 Promotion List** and SID<br>Awards List : we thought it important for everyone to see the results of the entire new pay<br>adjustment process. (**Just in case you did not read the fine print at the top, note that the<br>Promotion List gives the names by grade before promotion.)<br>(U//FOUO) The Workforce Performance Management Executive webpage soon will provide some<br>initial promotion statistics-- promotions by grade, by skill community, and by organization (high<br>level). Later, we will break the organization chart down further and chart promotions by work<br>roles. Our statistics will include a look at the entire "pay adjustment" process by presenting<br>promotions, QSIs, SSWPs, SAAs, etc. in some manner, to show the big picture. We also hope to<br>compile figures showing the P3 scores in comparison with the type of compensation individuals<br>received. Finally, we will analyze all of the above statistics to isolate the results of those who<br>turned in PRPs (rather than the entire population). If you have any good ideas on some useful<br>statistics, please let us know and we will see what we can do.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
