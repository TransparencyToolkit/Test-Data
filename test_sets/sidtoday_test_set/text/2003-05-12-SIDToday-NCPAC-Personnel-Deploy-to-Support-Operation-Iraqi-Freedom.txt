Analysts were<br>assigned various positions of responsibility in management, targeting, Battle Damage<br>Assessment (BDA), Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), watch supervision, and the Cryptologic<br>Services Group (CSG) watch. Every position was manned 24/7 throughout the conduct of the<br>campaign.<br>(S//SI) Activities included the development of time sensitive targeting through the fusion of<br>SIGINT and IMINT data, providing timely BDA derived from SIGINT, targeting of Iraqi air<br>defense assets based on ELINT collection, researching possible locations of stockpiled WMD<br>material, and leading the joint intelligence watch in providing timely support to all facets of the<br>campaign. Maintaining a constant dialogue with NSA-- including NSOC, Special Support Activity<br>(SSA), Battle Bridge, Geospatial Exploitation, Targeting Support Activity, and the Iraq Theater<br>Analysis Cell-- as well as GRSOC and the NSA representation at CENTCOM Forward, proved<br>extremely valuable in the accomplishment of each mission.<br>(C) Each NCPAC analyst gained valuable operational experience in providing SIGINT support in a<br>combat environment. This knowledge will be applied to ongoing NCPAC support to military<br>operations in the Pacific Area of Responsibility (AOR) and will enhance NCPAC's ability to support<br>a broader campaign in the region should the need arise. Likewise, CENTCOM benefited from the<br>diverse knowledge and capabilities of the augmentees. This challenging period reminded all of us<br>that we really are one team, and highlighted our organizational ability to pull together personnel<br>from across the enterprise to provide essential mission support to our warfighting customer.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
