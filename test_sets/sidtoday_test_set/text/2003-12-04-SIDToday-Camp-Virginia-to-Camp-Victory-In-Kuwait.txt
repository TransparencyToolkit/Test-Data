DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Camp Virginia to Camp Victory: In Kuwait<br>FROM:<br>IA Intern<br>Run Date: 12/04/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Prior to my NIST deployment, I had often heard that<br>the best opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery can<br>only be found when we are completely removed from our comfort<br>zone and forced to operate in an environment vastly different from<br>the one in which we live. I was able to live this adage first-hand<br>during my 90-day tour in Kuwait and Iraq at the beginning of<br>Operation Iraqi Freedom, which turned out to be one of the most<br>rewarding experiences of my life.<br>(U//FOUO) We left Ft. Meade around midnight on March 19, and a<br>small convoy of trucks and SUVs carried my team and our<br>equipment down to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. Dressed in<br>desert cammies and carrying gear and supplies, we boarded a C17 full of ammunition that would be used in the impending war. As<br>we prepared for our flight across the Atlantic we were told that the<br>US had fired its first missiles at a bunker where Saddam Hussein<br>and some of his regime's high-ranking officials were believed to be<br>meeting. As we approached the airfield at Camp Doha, Kuwait, I<br>heard many unfamiliar phrases, such as "full battle rattle",<br>"combat landing", and "MOPP 4", but the other members of my<br>team were all in the military and were more than willing to help me<br>assemble all my gear and prepare for whatever may await us as<br>we landed in the war zone.<br>(U//FOUO) Not an hour after we set foot on the ground we were<br>greeted by the haunting cry of air raid sirens, signaling the launch<br>of an Iraqi SCUD missile in our direction. This process was<br>repeated several times that day, and each time I pulled the gas<br>mask out of the pouch around my waist and fumbled to properly<br>secure it over my face as I ran to the nearest bunker. I admit that<br>the question, "What did I get myself into?" crossed my mind<br>several times as we drove through the middle of the Kuwaiti desert<br>to a tent village known as Camp Virginia, which would be our home<br>for the next six weeks. I laid wide-awake in my sleeping bag that<br>first night, a little excited and more than a little scared, knowing<br>that a war was beginning just on the other side of the border.<br>(U//FOUO) In the subsequent days and weeks, the incoming<br>missile alerts became less frequent as the SCUDs were shot out of<br>the air by the PATRIOTS that surrounded our camp, and their<br>launchers were destroyed by air strikes. As life returned to relative<br>normalcy, I was able to concentrate on the analysis that I was<br>there to do. Camp Virginia served as a staging ground for troops<br>moving back and forth across the Iraqi border, and also housed<br>the field headquarters of the US Army's V Corps, which was in<br>charge of all army combat divisions operating in the Iraqi theater.<br>These were the troops we were there to support, and we provided<br>crucial, actionable intelligence that helped them to identify targets<br>and ensure the safety of their forces. We worked 12-16 hour days,<br>7 days a week, partly because the mission demanded it and partly<br>because there was nothing else to do in the middle of the desert.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.

We did our laundry by hand in plastic bins, and<br>complained about the occasional sandstorm, our lack of air<br>conditioning, and having to use porta-johns and take showers in a<br>trailer (if we were lucky to have enough water). Life in Camp<br>Virginia was rough by western standards, but it was luxury<br>compared to the conditions we would later endure in Baghdad.<br>(U//FOUO) Watch for the second and final part of this article, Camp<br>Virginia to Camp Victory: Into Baghdad<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
