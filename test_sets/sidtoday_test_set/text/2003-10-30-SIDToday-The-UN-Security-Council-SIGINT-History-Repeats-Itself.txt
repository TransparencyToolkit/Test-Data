On 16 October the Council unanimously passed<br>UNSCR 1511, which provided a UN mandate for Iraq reconstruction and peacekeeping and<br>opened the way for UN member countries to contribute troops and money to the effort. Passage<br>of the Resolution had been given urgent priority by top U.S. officials (who wanted it in place<br>before a donors' conference for Iraq on 23-24 October), and its rescue - from what seemed to<br>be certain death just a week before the vote - has been hailed as a triumph of diplomacy and a<br>key turning point for the situation in Iraq.<br>(TS//SI) However, as with UNSCR 1441 (return of weapons inspectors to Iraq) last November,<br>passage of 1511 was at heart a triumph of SIGINT support. From the Resolution's initial<br>introduction in the UNSC in early September until the 16 October vote, NSA played a key role in<br>keeping U.S. policy makers in New York and Washington abreast (or ahead) of the many twists<br>and turns in the marathon negotiations. Reporting from across SID (especially from the UN,<br>Chinese, Russian, French, German, Syrian, Pakistani, and Mexican diplomatic shops) provided a<br>window into the planning and intentions of the principal players on the Council - and may have<br>even provided the Secretary of State and the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN with the<br>key information needed to ensure the unanimous vote.<br>(S//SI) Kudos for NSA reporting followed almost immediately after the vote. The U.S. Mission to<br>the UN's expert adviser on Iraq probably spoke for a number of customers at State and USUN by<br>stating,<br>"I don't think any of us should overlook - or underestimate - the critical role [NSA] played in<br>getting us to the finish line. The timely products that you provided to us in a constant stream<br>were critical in shifting the balance, particularly with the Chinese and Russians, and allowed us<br>to make tactical decisions real time with Secretary Powell that had the effect of isolating the<br>French and Germans as we saw the others peel off one by one. For obvious reasons [NSA]<br>doesn't get the public praise, but they should know how much more effective and more<br>successful they allow us to be. It's one of the real reasons, beyond luck, that we are the best at<br>what we do."<br>(U) Job well done, indeed!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
