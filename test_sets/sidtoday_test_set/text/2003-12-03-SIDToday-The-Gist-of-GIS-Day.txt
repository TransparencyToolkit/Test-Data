DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) The Gist of GIS Day<br>FROM:<br>Geospatial Exploitation Office, Operations Division (S2L1)<br>Run Date: 12/03/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) NSA joined over 600 worldwide local &amp; federal agencies, schools and businesses in<br>celebrating GIS Day on 19 November. The Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO), in coordination<br>with the Geographic Resource Center, Advanced Analysis Laboratory, and Intelligence Analysis<br>Skill Community, presented our GIS Day Event in the Friedman Auditorium. The theme of this<br>event was "GIS (Geographic Information Systems): Enabling Analysis &amp; Empowering<br>Customers". The purpose of NSA's GIS Day was to update the workforce on migration efforts<br>from legacy mapping tools to commercial-off-the-shelf spatial analysis tools.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. William B. Black, Jr, Deputy Director, NSA presented the keynote speech to over<br>250 NSA &amp; other IC communities attendees. Our guest speaker, Mr. John Young, Director,<br>Enterprise Solutions of Environmental Systems Research Institute, spoke about "GIS as an<br>Enterprise Application: Benefits and Challenges".<br>(S//SI) The day began with a video focusing on NSA's use of GIS tools. The video showed how<br>NSA has taken tremendous amounts of near-real-time SIGINT, analyzed it geospatially, and<br>provided that information directly to the warfighter. The video, produced by the NSA Television<br>Center, showed how the use of GIS helps us provide our customers with actionable intelligence.<br>(S//SI) With presentations including an overview of commercial tools, NSA Extensions, applied<br>analysis demos and geospatial data, NSA's GIS Day showed how GIS technology has become an<br>integral part of the SIGINT Analyst's toolbox. Of particular significance is the fact that GIS has<br>enabled the first multi-agency reporting in NSA history, as SIGINT and imagery are fused to<br>create joint NSA / NGA (formerly NIMA) reports.<br>(U) Presentations are available at the GIS Day topics website (or "go gis day").<br>(U) We are anxious to hear what you thought about GIS Day.
