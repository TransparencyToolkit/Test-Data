Over a period of four months,<br>guided by outside experts from the Technology Review Panel, a larger group of technical<br>directors from SID, RAD, and IAD put together a model of the critical functions they believed the<br>TRAILBLAZER Objective Program must provide.<br>(S//SI) The model, known as the Layered Zone Model (LZM), however, goes beyond the scope<br>of the Objective Program and is an end-to-end model SID will use to drive architecture,<br>planning, and programming. MG Quirk has approved its implementation in SID, and the Director<br>is sharing this message with IC (Intelligence Community) partners and the SCEs (Service<br>Cryptologic Elements). Next month, the LZM will be briefed to Second Party Partners at the DSD<br>and GCSB Bilateral Conferences in Hawaii.<br>(U/FOUO) A narrative on the LZM and Power Point pictures are now available on the SIGINT<br>Directorate web site (CLICK HERE) .
