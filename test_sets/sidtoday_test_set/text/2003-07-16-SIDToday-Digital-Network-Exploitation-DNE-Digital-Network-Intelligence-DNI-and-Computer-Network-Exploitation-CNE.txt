DNI is the resultant<br>intelligence that DNE produces.<br>(TS//SI) Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) - Active or<br>"end-point" collection, which involves the surreptitious<br>infiltration and mastery of computers and other<br>network components. Once a device or network has been<br>infiltrated, data of interest can be extracted directly or the<br>targeted system's operation can be modified to facilitate<br>mid-point collection (for instance, by covertly tagging data<br>of interest, rerouting data along accessible links, subtly<br>weakening encryption, etc.).<br>(TS//SI) DNE is independent of the type of access: the collection<br>can either be end-point or mid-point, active or passive, may (or<br>may not) use CNE methods/techniques. Collection is not limited to<br>a computer; it can be against any system or device in the digital<br>environment.<br>(S//SI) As our targets continue to migrate toward communications<br>that use the digital global network, DNE increasingly becomes the<br>center of our SIGINT business. This is evidenced by approximately<br>half of our current SID Strategic Objectives directly addressing our<br>need to improve DNE. The 3 V's (volume, velocity, variety) present<br>tremendous challenges in DNE. Our targets are moving from fixed<br>narrowband transmissions to shared, re-routable, extremely<br>wideband, multiplexed, multi-formatted transmissions. Each day,<br>new types of protocols and application formats appear in our<br>targets' communications. Finally, our targets communications are<br>increasingly buried by millions of non-target communications.<br>(TS//SI) The primary focus of SID's recent transformation efforts is<br>to improve our DNE. Fortunately, the business of DNE has some<br>great opportunities for improvement. The fact there is a global<br>network allows the concept of CNE collection. This allows us to<br>actively hunt the target instead of sifting through the chaff. Also,<br>most communications on the global network include some set of<br>labels about the source, destination and path of the information.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Data<br>Acquisition<br>1.

Finally,<br>the continued growth of standards and their widespread use in the<br>global network will allow us to use Commercial-Off-The-Shelf<br>(COTS) tools to portray the communications exactly the same way<br>the target sees it.<br>(S) In conclusion, DNE is an on-going challenge that has already<br>produced extremely valuable intelligence with great continued<br>promise. Through the coming months and years, we will accelerate<br>our exploitation of DNI and track targets through their migration<br>onto the global network.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
