DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Stand-up of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC)<br>FROM: Charlie Meals<br>Signals Intelligence Deputy Director<br>Run Date: 05/06/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Thursday, 1 May, marked the official stand-up of the Terrorist Threat Integration<br>Center (TTIC), located at CIA Headquarters. The TTIC was established by direction of the<br>President of the United States as the single U.S. government focal point for all terrorist threat<br>information, foreign and domestic.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. John Brennan, the TTIC Director, envisions the TTIC as the hub for information<br>on terrorism threats--a joint venture of member agencies bringing their authorities with them to<br>the TTIC. The TTIC staff is responsible for assessing, integrating, and expeditiously<br>disseminating available threat information and analysis; maintaining an all-source database on<br>known and suspected terrorists; and identifying collection requirements related to the terrorist<br>threat. They will ensure terrorist threat information is quickly turned around and delivered<br>through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to local and state officials and others as<br>needed.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. Bill Gaches has been assigned from NSA as the TTIC Deputy Director, Threat<br>Monitoring, Integration &amp; Analysis. <br> is the Senior NSA Representative to the<br>TTIC. She will:<br>coordinate NSA-TTIC activities;<br>share information with NSA analysts at CIA, FBI, DHS, and other agencies as needed;<br>and<br>provide support and "reach back" to NSA to facilitate all-source threat analysis from both<br>the Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and the Information Assurance (IA) Directorates.<br>(U//FOUO) NSA's association with the TTIC is a groundbreaking opportunity for the Agency to<br>support national decision-makers in the Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Community. I<br>attended Thursday's ribbon cutting ceremony on behalf of the Director, and I believe the TTIC<br>and DHS will complement each other in a way that will ensure the right people get the<br>information they need to protect the nation. Please join MG Quirk and me in fully supporting this<br>new, but vital, organization and in providing all possible assistance to the NSAers at TTIC.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information on the TTIC, contact<br><br> <br><br>(s).<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
