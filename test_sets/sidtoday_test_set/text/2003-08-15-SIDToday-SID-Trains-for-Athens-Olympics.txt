DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID Trains for Athens Olympics<br>FROM: 2Lt <br> USAF<br>SIGINT Communications<br>Run Date: 08/15/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) In just over a year the torch will be lit, and thus will kick off the 2004 Summer<br>Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, home to the first Olympic Games. Although the first race,<br>dive, and somersault are still a year away, the Intelligence Community is already in full "training<br>mode" for the event. In truth, NSA has been gearing up for the 2004 Olympics for quite some<br>time, in anticipation of playing a larger role than ever before at the international games.<br>(U) Prior Games<br>(S) The first phase of preparation actually began years ago through the involvement of NSA with<br>the Olympic Games in other cities. NSA has had an active role in the Olympics since the 1984<br>Los Angeles games, and has seen its involvement increase with the recent games in Atlanta,<br>Sydney, and Salt Lake City. During the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the focus was on<br>counterterrorism, and NSA acted largely in support of the FBI in a fusion cell known as the<br>Olympics Intelligence Center (OIC). The mission of the OIC was to fuse foreign intelligence and<br>law enforcement information to provide threat warning and situation awareness before and<br>during the games. NSA's support to the 2004 Olympics in Athens will be much more<br>complicated.<br>(U) The Athens Outlook<br>(S//SI) Several factors will make the Athens Olympics vastly different, not the least of which is<br>the fact these Olympics will not be held at a domestic location. Also different is that the security<br>organization that NSA will support is the EYP, or Greek National Intelligence Service. NSA will<br>gather information and tip off the EYP of possible terrorist or criminal actions. Without a doubt,<br>the communication between NSA and EYP will take some coordination, and for that reason<br>preparations are already underway.<br>(S//SI) NSA, and SID in particular, will be sending the largest contingent of personnel in support<br>of the games in our history. A team of 10 NSA analysts will arrive in Greece anywhere from 3045 days before the Olympics and stay until the flame is extinguished to provide the best support<br>possible to the safety and security of the games. It is also important to note that preparations<br>are being made for our in-house support to the games. NSOC again will serve as the single<br>point of contact for the Olympics for our customers. Work is being done across SID to work with<br>customers to receive and understand their specific Information Needs. Data Acquisition, working<br>with SIGINT Development, the Target Offices of Primary Interest, and the extended SIGINT<br>Enterprise, is preparing a comprehensive Olympics Collection Strategy. Moreover, SID is<br>partnering with the Foreign Affairs Directorate to develop a strategy to share threat information<br>with our SIGINT Partners.<br>(U//FOUO) The Olympic Games are perhaps the greatest platform for global unity, even if it is<br>for just a short time; but they are also an enormous target for would-be evildoers. Thousands<br>will participate and billions will be watching as the games unfold. The scope of the Olympics is<br>tremendous, and so will be the support of SID and NSA. The world will be watching, and so will<br>NSA!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
