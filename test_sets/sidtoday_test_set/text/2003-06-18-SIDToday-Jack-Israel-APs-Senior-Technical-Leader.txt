DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Jack Israel, A&amp;P;'s Senior Technical Leader<br>FROM: Jack Israel<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/18/2003<br><br>(U/FOUO) As the Technical Leader for Analysis &amp; Production<br>(A&amp;P;), my main concern is transformation of analysis, mission,<br>technology, and technical leadership. I ask myself on a weekly-- if<br>not daily-- basis, "Is A&amp;P; moving forward in these areas?" In<br>analysis, I would like to see progress in implementing many of the<br>ideas outlined in Richard Heuer's seminal work, The Psychology of<br>Intelligence Analysis . I believe this book should be required<br>reading for all A&amp;P; analysts because it so clearly lays out methods<br>for improving analysis and avoiding analytic pitfalls. As I look back<br>at some of the analytic work I did years ago, I see some of the<br>problems I had then with mindset, biases, and perception. Had I<br>known about many of the self-help steps described in this book, I<br>believe my work would have been even better.<br>(C) In mission and technology, my primary concern continues to be<br>making progress in Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). Voice<br>dominates our reporting today, yet DNI is much more prolific in the<br>global net. There are many reasons why DNI reporting has not<br>increased dramatically over the years: problems with access,<br>cultural proclivities, and the difficulty in working DNI. All of these<br>vie for my attention right now, and I feel confident that we can<br>provide analysts better access and tools in the near future.<br>(U/FOUO) Finally, building more technical leaders is essential. The<br>model of the new working relationship between senior<br>management and technical leaders was set at the creation of the<br>SIGINT Directorate. Great progress has been made in this regard<br>and will continue as technical experts supplement their knowledge<br>with an understanding of many basic SID processes such as<br>requirements, systems engineering, and programmatics.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Getting to Know the<br>SID Leadership Team<br>1.
