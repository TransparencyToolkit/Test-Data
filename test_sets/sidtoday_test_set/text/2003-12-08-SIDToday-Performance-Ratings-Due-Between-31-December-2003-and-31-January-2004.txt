DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Performance Ratings Due Between 31 December 2003 and 31<br>January 2004<br>FROM:<br><br> (SID Performance Management Executive) and<br><br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 12/08/2003<br>(U//FOUO) The P3 2003 cycle, closing date of 31 December 2003, is fast approaching (see the<br>P3 Guidance webpage for details), so we want to put the rating guidelines on record again. We<br>recognize that, given the very difficult conditions within which we operate, "doing our jobs" is<br>stellar performance. It does not mean you are merely average, it means that you are doing the<br>jobs you are supposed to be doing in the manner expected. Let's face it, our jobs are hard, but<br>to make this work we must all use consistent guidelines to assess performance objectively. Only<br>then will the P3 be the powerful tool we need, and better prepare us for a new compensation<br>system.<br>(U//FOUO) With this in mind, please refamiliarize yourself with the SID 2003 P3 Rating<br>Guidelines .<br>(U//FOUO) As you are all well aware by now, one of the Agency's goals is to be a well-aligned<br>organization having direct linkage at all levels of our strategic plan. Over the past year SID has<br>made considerable progress in defining, redefining and articulating our strategy and plan for the<br>SIGINT Enterprise. You can find the strategy and plan on the SID home page ("go si") under<br>"Reports and Briefings," the first three listings.<br>(U//FOUO) One of our key alignment tools for achieving the SID Strategic Plan's Goal 5,<br>Objective 4** is the Performance Management System (P3). Since 2001, all SID Seniors (both<br>DISES and DISL) have crafted their performance plans based on SID strategy and plan. Then all<br>SID workforce performance plans are to cascade from there to achieve alignment. While this<br>cascading process is time-consuming, it is integral to our goal of alignment at all levels of SID.<br>(U) Only through a truly collective effort, with everyone adhering consistently to the same<br>ratings guidance, will we achieve the objective of true performance management. Thanks in<br>advance for helping us work toward this important goal.<br>**(U//FOUO) Goal 5, Objective 4 is: "Influence the development of the corporate performance<br>management system, and ensure effective implementation within the SIGINT Enterprise to<br>properly assess performance, reward significant achievement and shape the workforce."<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
