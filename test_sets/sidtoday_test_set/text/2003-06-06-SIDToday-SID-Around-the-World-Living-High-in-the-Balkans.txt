DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Around the World: Living High in the Balkans<br>FROM:<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/06/2003<br><br>(C) One thing is for certain. If you spend a significant amount of<br>time anywhere in what used to constitute the former Socialist<br>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ), you will definitely get a good<br>meal. Having traveled the world over, I believe that cuisine in<br>Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro is<br>some of the best food anywhere. But cuisine is only a small part of<br>what makes the Balkans special.<br>(C) As background, I am a former Air Force linguist who attended<br>DLI (Defense Language Institute) in 1977, way before anyone<br>thought that Serbo-Croatian would be such a valuable language at<br>NSA. I was stationed in Yugoslavia as an intelligence assistant to<br>the U.S. Defense Attache Office, Belgrade, and have been TDY to<br>the Balkans theater literally dozens of times supporting a variety of<br>offices at NSA.<br>(C) I was in Belgrade in 1989 during the 600th Anniversary<br>Celebration of the Battle of Kosovo Polje. This event signalled the<br>rise of Slobodan Milosevic to power, a man who ultimately caused<br>the collapse of Yugoslavia. During that trip, I was able to visit the<br>beautiful city of Dubrovnik. The next time I saw Dubrovnik, it was<br>being shelled by Yugoslav People's Army artillery literally<br>destroying a centuries-old historic city. Unfortunately, that was<br>only the beginning of the nightmare for the Balkans. For almost a<br>decade, war ravaged almost every corner of the "former<br>Yugoslavia." NSA supported and still supports the myriad, alphabet<br>soup of peacekeeping operations throughout the Balkans UNPROFOR, UNTAES, UNMOP, IFOR, SFOR, and finally KFOR.<br>(C) Being on the front lines, sometimes living in tents or buildings<br>partially destroyed by war and supporting these operations was<br>professionally very rewarding, even though many times it meant<br>spending significant time away from family and friends. But the<br>opportunity to support the visit of President Clinton to Tuzla Air<br>Base in January 1996, to work at a variety of new, state-of-the-art<br>collection facilities supporting national policy-makers and<br>commanders on the ground, meeting ambassadors and four star<br>generals, the Secretary of State, and touring Air Force 2, are once<br>in a lifetime experiences.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.
