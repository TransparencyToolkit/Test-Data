It was established by Lieutenant<br>General John A. Samford, Director, NSA, in a memorandum dated<br>October 1957. The CMI has been an integral part of the<br>mathematics community at NSA ever since its inception.<br>(U//FOUO) The purpose of the Institute is to promote those<br>aspects of mathematics which pertain to cryptology and to provide<br>a focal point for the NSA mathematics community in fields of<br>common interest. To foster a sense of community as well as<br>technical excellence, CMI sponsors a variety of social and scholarly<br>events, including a newsletter, monthly seminars, pizza parties for<br>new hires, and a classified mathematics conference called<br>MATHFEST ( see related article in today's NSA Daily ).<br>(U//FOUO) The Institute celebrates the end of each academic year<br>with the CMI awards banquet, a social event centered around the<br>presentation of the new Distinguished Members, the CMI<br>President's Award, and the CMI Teaching Award, and the essay<br>contest winners:<br>(U//FOUO) CMI Distiguished Members are inducted<br>every year from retirees in the extended mathematics<br>community, including IDA (the Institute for Defense<br>Analyses) and Second Parties. This Cryptomath Hall of Fame<br>currently features 93 members.<br>(U//FOUO) The CMI President's Award (mathematician of<br>the year), established in 1978, recognizes Agency personnel<br>who are making important contributions to the mission of<br>the cryptologic community through the development and<br>application of the science of mathematical cryptology.<br>(U//FOUO) The Crypto-Mathematics Institute has also<br>presented the CMI Teacher's Award at its annual banquet<br>since 1997, to honor important teaching contributions to<br>the mathematics community.<br>(U//FOUO) Since 1959, the Crypto-Mathematics Institute<br>has sponsored an annual Essay Contest to recognize<br>outstanding written contributions to the fields of<br>mathematics and cryptology. Research papers are judged<br>on their contributions to the general theory of<br>cryptomathematics or cryptology, while applications papers<br>should offer innovative uses of cryptomathematical<br>techniques to solve specific problems.<br>(U//FOUO) A complete listing of CMI activities appears on our<br>internal web site.
