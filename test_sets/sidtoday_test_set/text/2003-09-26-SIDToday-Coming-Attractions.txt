DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Coming Attractions<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/26/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) We'd like to take this opportunity to tell you about some new features that you'll be<br>seeing in SID today . First, starting soon, you can expect to see a series of regular articles from<br>SID-level managers - SID Director MG Quirk, Deputy Director Charlie Meals, and SID Chief of<br>Staff Charles Berlin - who will tell you, from their unique perspectives, of the important events<br>happening in the directorate. We think that this will help keep you well informed of<br>developments that may affect all of SID. We anticipate that articles from MG Quirk and Charlie<br>Meals will run monthly, and items from Charles Berlin semi-monthly (or fortnightly?).<br>(U//FOUO) There are some other changes you will see. We will soon have available a "Submit an<br>Article Idea" button on the page, as well as a "Letter to the Editor" feature to let readers<br>comment on issues raised in SID today . In addition, we expect to post a form for submitting<br>requests for the release of SID-all email messages.<br>(U//FOUO) Finally, since articles often appear for only a day before disappearing into the<br>archives, we will start posting a list of "Recent Articles" at the bottom of the SID today<br>homepage. This should make it easier to catch up on articles you may have missed if you<br>haven't visited the page for a few days. (Thanks to our colleagues in Multimedia Solutions for<br>making all this possible.)<br>(U//FOUO) We hope you like the new features - let us know if you have other suggestions.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
