DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Leadership Transition: Passing the Baton<br>FROM: Maureen Baginski<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 04/03/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Soon there will be a press report announcing my appointment as<br>the FBI's Director of Intelligence. I assume that post in May as an FBI<br>employee. The decision to accept the position was among the most<br>emotion-filled and difficult I've ever made. I feel blessed and deeply honored to be given an<br>opportunity to continue to serve the nation in this new capacity and to work with a team of great<br>Americans dedicated to protecting our homeland. I promise to work hard and do my best for you<br>and yours in this role, and always.<br>(U//FOUO) Timing is everything in life, and it's natural to question mine in making this decision.<br>I did. In the end, I decided that we don't always control the timing of opportunities to serve, and<br>since work is never truly "done," there is never really a "right" time to depart. General Hayden<br>will announce my successor in short order and I know that whoever is selected, he or she will be<br>in good hands-- those of the best SIGINT professionals in the world.<br>(C) We have accomplished wonderful things for the nation's SIGINT capability over the past 2<br>1/2 years. It's a universally held view that SIGINT has never been better and that's a tribute to<br>each and every one of you who make it work every single day, sometimes against incredible<br>odds. We all know that there's more work to do, but work doesn't bother us. What amazes me<br>and makes me proud is that we have become a team that does not feel defeated by the<br>difference between where we are and where we want to be, but rather gets energized by it and<br>uses it to spur us to action and success. And succeed we have. You have my deepest respect and<br>admiration today and always.<br>(C) Last week I had the opportunity to walk around in the wee hours of the morning and visit<br>the folks standing watch for Americans in harm's way in Iraq and around the world. That<br>experience was a gift that I will forever cherish. Everywhere I went, I saw what I expected-ruthless focus on the task at hand. I also saw something I didn't expect that delighted me..it<br>was the look and feel of teamwork and empowered professionals with a quiet confidence in our<br>collective ability to get the job done. There wasn't one stop where folks didn't go out of their<br>way to describe the team they were part of that produced the superb results for customers.<br>Thank you all, not just for what you do, but the way you do it. We have changed to meet the<br>challenges of 21st Century SIGINT and our products and services have never been better. I've<br>never been prouder to be part of anything and I thank you all for the support and<br>encouragement you have given me along the way. I'll always remember it.<br>(U//FOUO) But just so you don't think I'm going all mushy on you, there's plenty more work to<br>do and there will be more bumps along the road. Please know that I will be cheering you along<br>as you create the future for SIGINT. You will have a great fan, a trusted partner, and a very<br>demanding customer at the FBI. I look forward to continuing our work together in defense of the<br>nation. It has truly been an honor to serve with you all.<br> <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
