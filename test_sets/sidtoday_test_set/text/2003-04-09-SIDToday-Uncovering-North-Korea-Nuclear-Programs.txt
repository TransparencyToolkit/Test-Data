DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) Uncovering North Korea Nuclear Programs<br>FROM: Frances J. Fleisch<br>Deputy Production Manager, China/Korea Product Line<br>Run Date: 04/09/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Not long ago, a State Department delegation to Pyongyang confronted North Korean<br>officials with evidence that they had violated the 1994 U.S./North Korea Nuclear Agreed<br>Framework. The U.S. knew that the North Koreans were developing a uranium enrichment<br>capability--an effort banned by the treaty. To the surprise of many, the North Koreans admitted<br>that this was true and declared the Framework to be null and void.<br>(S//SI) How did the U.S. know what the North Koreans were doing? SIGINT! The ONLY source<br>of information on this treaty violation was SIGINT derived from North Korean external<br>communications. A collaborative effort involving SID's China and Korea and the Proliferation and<br>Arms Control Product Lines put the SIGINT pieces together.<br>(S//SI) Furthermore, our Intelligence Community colleagues provided technical information (CIA<br>and DOE), initiated operational efforts (CIA), conducted imagery searches (NIMA), reviewed<br>historical information (DIA and FBIS), and issued demarches (State Department) related to this<br>uranium enrichment program.<br>(S//SI) Without this intelligence, the U.S. would have been unaware of the North Korean<br>enrichment program, which, if successful, would both enhance North Korea's nuclear weapons<br>programs and enable it to proliferate nuclear weapons material to other nations of concern. This<br>is both a SIGINT success story and an example of how cross-organizational collaboration can<br>produce key intelligence.
