The strategic goal behind the DCI and DIRNSA intent to share more<br>information with valued partners is not only to foster SIGINT relationships but to also assist<br>other U.S. intelligence programs and realize broader U.S. national policy objectives. The<br>Customer Relationships Directorate's Office of Customer Response established the Partnership<br>Dissemination Cell (PDC) to turn this intent into a reality.<br>(TS//SI) The PDC is part of the SIGINT Products Services Branch, within Customer Response's<br>Products &amp; Services Division. The PDC processes information-sharing requests generated by NSA<br>representatives such as Senior Liaison Officers (SLOs), Country Desk Officers (CDOs), and<br>National Cryptologic Representatives (NCRs). Most requests are for permission to share<br>information from E-GRAM end-product reports-- up to the TOP SECRET COMINT 5-EYES<br>classification level-- with specific Third Party Partners. Current requests pertain to the global war<br>on terrorism, Iraq, and proliferation/arms control. The bulk of the sharing is done with our<br>European partners, along with Turkey (terrorism), Japan (terrorism), South Korea (Iraq), and<br>Jordan (Iraq).<br>(S//SI) PDC analysts also work within prescribed guidelines authorized by the Directorate for<br>Analysis &amp; Production product lines to select, review, modify, and/or sanitize specified SIGINT<br>reporting to determine applicability and suitability for release to selected foreign SIGINT<br>partners. These authorized guidelines are in place as a means to streamline the sharing process<br>and often allow the PDC to review and release information without the need for product line<br>coordination.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information, please feel free to visit the Partnership Dissemination Cell in<br>the Headquarters building - room 5A132, call <br> or email the PDC alias,<br>@nsa.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
