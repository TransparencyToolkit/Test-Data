DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Working at Prince Sultan Air Base, SA<br>FROM:<br>IA Intern<br>Run Date: 12/17/2003<br><br>(S//SI) The call went out shortly after 9/11 for a military O2/O3 to<br>deploy to the CENTCOM Area of Operations (AO) to support the<br>campaign in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom - OEF) as<br>well as continuing support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW) as<br>Chief of the Cryptologic Services Group (CSG) CENTCOM (Fwd).<br>Having just left active-duty as a US Army Captain a couple of<br>months prior, I hesitantly inquired with the NIST office if they<br>would consider re-activating me for this deployment. After a day or<br>two of realizing the amount of paperwork that would require, the<br>NIST folks decided that they would just send me in my civilian<br>capacity, and I was on a plane to Saudi Arabia before the ink on my<br>new passport was dry.<br>(S) The shades were drawn, the lights were out, and the transport<br>plane hit the tarmac hard in the middle of the Arabian night. The<br>cargo door slid open revealing a desolate dune-capped landscape<br>lined with rows of razor wire and guard towers. The airfield itself<br>was enormous - more than capable of handling the F-16 fighters,<br>French Mirages, British Tornados, and RC-135 and U-2 surveillance<br>aircraft that lay clustered under makeshift hangars. It was from<br>here that the US and her NATO allies prosecuted OSW - the<br>oversight and compliance enforcement of keeping Saddam's<br>military in check.<br> <br>Sunrise at the compound<br>(S) Feeling a bit like Jack Ryan (a'la Tom Clancy's "Clear and<br>Present Danger") I was given access to an enormous white<br>armored Suburban in which to transport myself and my fellow CSG<br>members the 15 miles to-and-from our secure living compound to<br>the airfield. Now, having spent more than 8 years in the Army<br>sleeping in the woods, I was fully prepared to spend the next 4<br>months in sub-standard living conditions, working as I was on the<br>"front line" of the Global War on Terrorism. This, however, was an<br>Air Force Base, and I'm embarrassed to say that it actually had a<br>pool ! I was housed in an air-conditioned dorm room directly<br>across from the Burger King and beside the movie house. Well, the<br>BK was a trailer, and the movie house was a giant tent, but still this was certainly not the hardship of Afghanistan.<br> <br>Combined Forces Compound Entrance<br>(S) But then, it wasn't Club Med either. Prince Sultan Air Base was<br>born from the tragedy of the Khobar Towers bombing in Dharan in<br>1996 that killed 19 American servicemen. Terrorism, then as now,<br>was a definite reality in Saudi Arabia, and the security there was<br>more stringent than any I'd ever seen in my prior military<br>deployments. Despite the tremendous security efforts, Saudi forces<br>found a spent SA-7 launcher within the airbase perimeter while I<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.

Dispatch from CSG<br>Baghdad<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">was there, indicating that someone had recently infiltrated the post<br>and launched a surface-to-air missile at a coalition aircraft during<br>their vulnerable takeoff or landing profile. Luckily, the missile<br>missed its mark.<br> <br>Me at my workplace, the JIC<br>(TS//SI//REL) The day-to-day work in the CSG was fascinating,<br>and I never knew what was going to happen next. Although the<br>watch on Iraq was rather low-key compared to the action of<br>Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) a year later, this was during the<br>initial stages of OEF, and I had the opportunity to help manage<br>SIGINT operations for such notable Afghanistan operations as<br>Operation Anaconda. One particularly noteworthy graveyard shift<br>found me alone in the CSG when the call came in that an MC-130<br>Special Operations aircraft had crashed near an Afghan village, and<br>I had to coordinate the national and tactical cryptologic support<br>through the Combined Air Operations Center to facilitate the<br>recovery of the survivors before Taliban forces could threaten the<br>crash site. Other instances had me putting to use my prior training<br>as an Army Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Officer in<br>coordinating SIGINT support to psychological operations in<br>Southern Iraq, encouraging Iraqi forces not to fire on coalition<br>aircraft. I even had the opportunity to fly on the RC-135 "Rivet<br>Joint" COMINT/ELINT collection aircraft as it ferreted out Iraqi<br>communications along the Saudi border. It was one heck of an<br>intern tour!<br>(U//FOUO) My recommendation: go to the NIST webpage now and<br>volunteer for a deployment.
