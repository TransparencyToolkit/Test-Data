DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Latest SID Leadership Offsite: Seeing the Big Picture<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/02/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) In early August, MG Quirk convened the SID Leadership Team for a two-day offsite,<br>their third offsite meeting in recent months. This gathering was dedicated to understanding the<br>authorities and responsibilities delegated to SID by the DIRNSA. MG Quirk emphasized to the<br>group that we - SID - are responsible to DIRNSA for the operation of the entire U.S. SIGINT<br>System (USSS). In the past, we've not always taken such a broad view of our responsibilities,<br>but we must grow into this job.<br>(U//FOUO) Where to begin? As a start, the leaders set out to identify their most significant<br>responsibilities. Keep in mind that part of taking responsibility for SID's strategic direction<br>means enabling tactical decisions to be made at specified lower levels, by those who are most<br>familiar with the specific issues. Through this initial discussion, they concluded that SID's<br>responsibilities include:<br>Optimize SIGINT Value for Customers<br>Guide the Building of the USSS Workforce for Tomorrow<br>Develop and Acquire SIGINT Systems for NSA and Support such Development and<br>Acquisition across the USSS<br>Plan and Program for Future SIGINT Capabilities<br>Synchronize Current Operations of the SIGINT System<br>Execute NSA, IC, &amp; DoD Corporate Responsibilities<br>(U//FOUO) Perhaps most surprising was the degree of SID responsibility for SIGINT excellence<br>across the entire US SIGINT System. Executing those broad responsibilities as part of a<br>collaborative SIGINT team can yield great results for all members, and may be our greatest<br>challenge.<br>(U//FOUO) Additional offsites will be conducted to further define high- and lower-level<br>responsibilities. What's to be gained by all this effort? The result of this process will be to help<br>everyone in SID recognize the breadth of their responsibilities and allow them to understand<br>clearly their role in the USSS "big picture". This should, in turn, bring cohesiveness to our<br>business methods and reflect in the quality of our product. The end goal remains: to provide the<br>best possible SIGINT to enlighten the nation's decision-makers.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
