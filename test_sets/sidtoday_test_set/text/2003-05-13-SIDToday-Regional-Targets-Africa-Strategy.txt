These<br>lessons have now been applied towards our SIGINT efforts elsewhere on the continent, in the<br>form of SID/Regional Targets' Africa Strategy.<br>(S//SI) The Strategy builds on the four central lessons learned, which now form the<br>cornerstones of a SIGINT strategy . These include the need to:<br>collaborate (with CIA, the Commands, GRSOC, 2nd/3rd Parties, and carefully selected<br>African governments),<br>smartly allocate scarce resources (by focusing resources temporarily on crisis and<br>pre-emergent hot spots),<br>augment the linguistic/analytic workforce (using contractors as a force<br>multiplier/teaming with host nation linguists), and<br>improve agility through SIGINT development and training.<br>The Strategy focuses Regional Targets' Sub-Saharan Africa Division on how best to protect<br>American lives, property, and national interests in Africa by responding to a wide spectrum of<br>customer Intelligence Needs. It takes into account numerous factors, such as prospects for<br>cooperating with other governments and potential new sources of collection sponsored by the<br>European Command (EUCOM).<br>(S//SI) The post-9/11 surge against terrorist-related targets on the Horn has now become<br>manageable--this has freed up some analysts and linguists to look at the "rest of Africa." NSA<br>managers have done predictive analysis and held planning sessions with SINIOs and customers<br>to help them make informed decisions in positioning these personnel. The Division's<br>organizational structure is now flatter than in the past, with few managers and every available<br>linguist and analyst working some part of the SIGINT production cycle. The workforce is<br>organized regionally, with resources allocated according to the needs of the Global War on<br>Terrorism. Analysts engage various elements of the Extended Enterprise and external<br>organizations to help produce SIGINT-- the Division is eager to collaborate with any partner who<br>can fill a gap or enhance effectiveness.<br>(S//SI) The Africa Plan is being implemented within the Division by internally staffed Focus<br>Groups formed around the "cornerstones" mentioned above. These Focus Groups generate ideas<br>and actions and help the Division stay aggressive. It is entirely possible that these focus groups<br>will morph into quasi-managerial units from which Division-wide guidance and tasking will<br>originate.
