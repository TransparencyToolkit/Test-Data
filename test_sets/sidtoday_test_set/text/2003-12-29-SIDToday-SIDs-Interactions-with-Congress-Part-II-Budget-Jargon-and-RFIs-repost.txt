Here are a few<br>terms you may hear:<br>Fence : When NSA funding is fenced, it means we cannot spend those dollars until we<br>satisfy certain requirements levied on us by Congress. Fences are associated with<br>Congressional Directed Actions (CDAs).<br>With/Without Prejudice : When a cut is taken "with prejudice", it means that NSA<br>must take the cut from a specified project/program. If a cut is taken "without prejudice",<br>we have the option of funding that program/project at the level we requested and taking<br>that cut from elsewhere in the budget.<br>A not A : Appropriated not Authorized. This occurs when the Appropriators provide<br>funding for programs, but the Authorizers do not give NSA the authority to spend it.<br>Hollow Authority : This occurs when the Authorizers give NSA the authority to spend<br>funds, however, the Appropriators do not provide us the with the dollars.<br>Congressional Member/Staffer : The "member" is the senator or congressman. The<br>"staffer" is just that--one of his staff. The staffers are led by a "staff director". Sensitive<br>classified information is sometimes shared only with the staff director and members of<br>Congress--not with the staffers-- to limit distribution as much as possible.<br>(U) Which Congressional Staffers Do We Usually Deal With?<br>(U//FOUO) SID often works with specific congressional staffers, as follows:<br>HPSCI: Riley Perdue (majority staffer) and Beth Larson (minority staffer)<br>SSCI: Jim Barnett<br>HAC-Defense: Steve Nixon<br>SAC-Defense: Jennifer Chartrand<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
