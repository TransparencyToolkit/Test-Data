We see<br>on an almost daily basis that conditions in Iraq remain extremely dangerous, with American and<br>coalition forces very much in harm's way. In light of this, and because a successful outcome in<br>Iraq is of such critical importance to our nation, it is essential that Signals Intelligence resurrect<br>the support and level of effort that were so pronounced when bombs were falling. We are<br>aggressively reopening the front and focusing once again on Iraq with the same emphasis we<br>had during the buildup to the war.<br>(S//SI) As we prepared for Operation Iraqi Freedom, SID stood up the Iraq Issue Management<br>Team (IMT) to ensure the entire SIGINT system was optimized to support the campaign. The<br>three Issue Managers, Dave Hurry of Customer Relationships, Wayne Murphy of Analysis and<br>Production and Greg Smithberger (later replaced by<br> as Greg went forward as NCR<br>CENTCOM) of Data Acquisition, performed exceptionally well to ensure that SIGINT was prepared<br>and organized to play a vital role in Operation Iraqi Freedom. They have all moved on to new<br>positions with our thanks and gratitude.<br>(S//SI) To address the complex and difficult issues the U.S. now faces in Iraq - the formation of<br>a new government, force protection for our military and coalition partners, post-war<br>reconstruction, and more, I've named a new Iraq Issue Management Team -- Ron Carback, Bill<br>Edinger and Rob Joyce. The new IMT continues to serve as the executives in SID for Iraq. They<br>are charged with aggressively reassessing our capabilities, ensuring the national and tactical<br>SIGINT systems are synchronized, identifying and resolving gaps and deficiencies in the SIGINT<br>system, and ensuring we contribute to the post-war Iraqi rebuilding effort.<br>(S//SI) The IMT will be setting up a rehearsal ( a ROCKDRILL ) very soon with SIGINT<br>customers and SIGINT producers to re-baseline our assumptions and goals for Iraq. Out of this<br>planning process will emerge an updated strategy to provide force protection, cover the<br>emerging leadership, root out terrorism within Iraq and continue the hunt for weapons of mass<br>destruction. I ask you to fully support the Iraq IMT and the overall campaign: SIGINT will<br>continue to be an essential source of intelligence on Iraq, and the one most likely to save lives.<br>(U//FOUO) Note: the new Iraq IMT can be reached at <br>line will soon have a STU-III capability.)<br><br>.
