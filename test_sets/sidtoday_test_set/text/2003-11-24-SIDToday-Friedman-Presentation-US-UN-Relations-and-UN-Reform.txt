A UN presence! The United Nations<br>touches every region of the world and UN representatives, missions, and organizations are<br>involved in the resolution of most of the major intra- and interstate conflicts across the globe. It<br>is in the United Nations that 191 member countries come together and work to resolve such<br>critical global issues as HIV/AIDS, non-proliferation, hunger, and organized crime and narcotics.<br>(S//SI) The shift from a bi-polar, Euro-centric world to a single superpower amid a sea of<br>national and regional entities vying for increased global prominence, in an era of increasing<br>transnational threats, offers serious challenges for the post-World War II construct that is the<br>United Nations. As the issue of UN reform becomes increasingly important to US policymakers,<br>State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs is charged with taking the lead<br>in US efforts on this issue. Please join The Honorable Kim R.
