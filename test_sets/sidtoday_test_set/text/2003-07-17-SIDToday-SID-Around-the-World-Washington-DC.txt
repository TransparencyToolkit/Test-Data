DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Around the World: Washington, D.C.<br>FROM:<br>Chief, CSG Joint Staff<br>Run Date: 07/17/2003<br><br>(C//SI) Sometimes a field assignment does not require a major<br>move. Having already had five overseas assignments, my wife and<br>I just couldn't face packing up and moving yet again. So I found a<br>"local" assignment in Arlington, VA. CSG Joint Staff is located in<br>the Pentagon, providing SIGINT support to the Chairman, Joint<br>Chiefs of Staff, the J-2 (Directorate for Intelligence), and the Joint<br>Staff. CSG Joint Staff members find themselves in the middle of<br>nearly every crisis situation that comes into the Pentagon because<br>SIGINT usually provides the bulk of the information related to<br>those events.<br>(U) The daily commute to the Pentagon, while longer than my<br>commute to Fort Meade, is really not so difficult due to our shift<br>schedule, and parking is no worse than what we have at NSA.<br>Inside the building, however, is another story. The Pentagon is like<br>a museum with a variety of displays throughout the building. Just<br>inside the river entrance is an outstanding display on the life and<br>career of President Eisenhower. Other displays include the career<br>of General Omar Bradley, NATO, ANZUS, the USO, and D-Day.<br>There is also a small chapel with a memorial to the Pentagon<br>victims of September 11.<br>(U) What's so exciting about being here? Well, we often see issues<br>we've worked on being discussed later on TV by the Secretary of<br>Defense. And like Forrest Gump, I occasionally just happen to<br>show up in areas where big-name people are passing by, such as<br>Gen. Tommy Franks and (gasp!) Brit Hume. But the most exciting<br>part of the job is working under a tight deadline to provide<br>intelligence that is needed "right now or sooner" by primary<br>customers who will put it to use. This sense of urgency, coupled<br>with the face-to-face contact with our customers, makes for a true<br>feeling of job satisfaction.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are thinking of applying for a field position, see<br>the Extended Enterprise Vacancy Announcements .<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.
