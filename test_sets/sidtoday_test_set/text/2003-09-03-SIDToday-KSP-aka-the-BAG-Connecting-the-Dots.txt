DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) KSP (aka the 'BAG'): Connecting the Dots<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/03/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Hundreds of databases, trillions of pieces of information... how can a SID analyst see<br>patterns and extract what is needed? This is the question that the Knowledge System Prototype<br>(KSP, which includes the "Big Awesome Graph" or "BAG") is striving to answer. While other<br>programs such as Trailblazer and Rebuilding Analysis are working on unifying SID's databases<br>and computer applications, what KSP aims to do is a little different. It wants to help find pieces<br>of information scattered throughout our hundreds of databases and show how they interrelate<br>with each other. KSP will enable analysts to "connect the dots" across vast amounts of data - a<br>process that would often take forever for an analyst to do by hand.<br>(S//SI) It should be noted that KSP is not just an idea or a way of doing things - it's actually<br>going to be a real "box" that does something. Namely, it will help analysts sort through<br>information from various sources - reference information, target knowledge, contact info, raw<br>data - to see trends that might not otherwise be apparent.<br>(S//SI) Let's look at a simple example to see how it would work. First, an analyst may ask KSP<br>to find all organizations in several named countries that have the word "trading" in them. Once<br>this information is displayed, the analyst may then have those organizations' known email<br>addresses and phone numbers added to the display. From this, certain trends may appear. For<br>example, perhaps two of the organizations are companies that share a common phone number an indication that the same company may go by multiple names. Or perhaps two companies<br>have similar email addresses, even though they are located in different countries - again, a sign<br>that they may be affiliated.<br>(S//SI) One interesting feature of KSP is that it will independently search through the available<br>data to find and store additional occurrences of this scenario. So, in this example, it would find<br>all other cases where companies with different names use the same phone number or email<br>address. Since KSP is "anticipating" questions, it can have the answers already prepared and<br>ready to go for the next time an analyst asks that question. As a result, the analyst will not need<br>to wait for KSP to crunch through trillions of records to answer every query; often, it will be able<br>to provide an answer very quickly.<br>(S//SI) Using the current prototype, the KSP team expects to have a demonstration capability<br>prepared by November 2003. Then they plan to work with users to refine it, and incrementally<br>deploy it out to the workforce. Watch for further developments!
