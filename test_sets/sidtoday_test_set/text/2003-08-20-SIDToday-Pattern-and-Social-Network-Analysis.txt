It's very<br>challenging to know when to apply different methodologies to<br>achieve the results we need. Social Network Analysis (SNA) and<br>Pattern Analysis are analytic methodologies that have been<br>successful against counterterrorism targets and may likely prove<br>successful in pursuing other targets.<br>(C) Social Network Analysis<br>(C) As a practical example, when you want to influence your boss's<br>decision on an important matter, how and through whom do you<br>relay your point of view? Based on your own SNA of the workplace,<br>you will contact the person in the best position to influence your<br>boss and you'll communicate via the mode that you consider most<br>effective. Your target works that way too, and the better you<br>understand the structure of the social networks, the better your<br>chances of finding weaknesses that can be leveraged for SIGINT<br>advantage.<br>(S//SI) SNA can help you identify people who, although they may<br>not be significant in the "official" leadership hierarchy, have<br>influential personal ties to people in high places. This is possible<br>because SNA consolidates large volumes of current SIGINT<br>reporting to provide a bird's eye view of a network and how it is<br>connected. SNA conducted against two years' worth of SIGINT data<br>on terrorist Abu Zubaida and his network showed a highly<br>interconnected group of 300 terrorists who were still largely<br>connected even after Zubaida was arrested and removed from the<br>picture. This stands in sharp contrast to open source "conventional<br>wisdom" which holds that terrorist organizations are structured<br>into isolated cells, where most of the people have little knowledge<br>of or contact with others.<br>(C) Pattern Analysis<br>(S//SI) How can NSA help find the al-Qa'ida terrorists who may<br>soon carry out an attack in the U.S., without knowing their names<br>or anything else about them? One answer is the Terrorist Threat<br>Pattern Analysis Model developed by the Counterterrorism<br>Strategic Intelligence and Operations Center (SIOC). CT SIOC<br>thoroughly analyzed the calamitous events of 11 September 2001<br>(and the events leading up to it) to try to stop such an event from<br>occurring again. That analysis revealed that most of the September<br>11th hijackers were not known to intelligence services throughout<br>the world and, therefore, did not draw the attention of those<br>services. Without knowing in advance that these people were<br>terrorists, and with no names, passport numbers, or other<br>identifying information, the Intelligence Community could not track<br>them. Pattern analysis helps us defeat such a foe. By determining<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Analysis<br>1.  Strengthening Our<br>Analytic Capability<br>2.

By<br>converting that model into algorithms and running those algorithms<br>against SIGINT, NSA hopes to identify potential terrorists base on<br>their patterns of activity before they are able to carry out their<br>attacks.<br>(U) Conclusion<br>(C) So, if you don't know exactly who your target is, but he<br>repeats his methods of operations, pattern analysis may help you<br>find him. Likewise, if you want to uncover people or ascertain their<br>significance and role in your target network, you might want to try<br>SNA. Hopefully, we've given you some food for thought so you can<br>begin to look at your target in a different way and consider<br>employing these methodologies to your SIGINT advantage.
