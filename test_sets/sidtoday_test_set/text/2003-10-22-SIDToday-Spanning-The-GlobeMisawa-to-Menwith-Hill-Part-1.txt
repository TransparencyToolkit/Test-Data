DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Spanning The Globe...Misawa to Menwith Hill: Part 1<br>FROM:<br>Software Development Team Menwith Hill Station<br>Run Date: 10/22/2003<br><br>(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: This is the first of a twopart article.<br>(U//FOUO) It took only one PCS and my husband announced that<br>he was officially a "field rat." This proclamation is even more<br>amazing given that our first PCS was to Misawa, Japan. We<br>completed four fabulous years in Misawa in May 2003 (yes, I said<br>"fabulous" and "Misawa" in the same sentence) and are now<br>stationed at Menwith Hill, in England. Misawa and Menwith Hill are<br>no doubt unique, but each has its advantages.<br>(U) Professional<br>(U//FOUO) By comparison, Misawa is a small site (fewer than 25<br>NSA civilians) while Menwith is a large site (several hundred NSA<br>civilians). Misawa offers the opportunity to take on added<br>responsibility well beyond grade expectations and to effect change<br>throughout the site. The advantage of a large site is the diversity of<br>the opportunities available, and Menwith is not lacking in its<br>breadth or depth of opportunities. As a computer scientist, there<br>are opportunities to develop operational or administrative software<br>solutions, tackle challenging problems in the emerging<br>development environment, work as a system engineer or project<br>manager, or lead teams of military, civilians and contractors doing<br>technology related jobs.<br>(U) Travel<br>(U) When it comes to travel (one of our passions), both locations<br>offer limitless possibilities that are as diverse as the professional<br>environments. Misawa and Menwith are both considered "remote",<br>Misawa being 450 miles from Tokyo and Menwith being 200 miles<br>from London, yet both locations are connected to their respective<br>capital by rail, air, and highway. The difference is in the cost and<br>availability of each.<br>(U) We found travel around Asia from Misawa to be expensive (the<br>cost of getting to and from Tokyo adds $300 per person to any<br>trip). Still, we vacationed in Guam, Alaska, Australia, Thailand,<br>Singapore, Malaysia and Hawaii (5 times and 4 islands)! Within<br>Japan, we visited Tokyo (too many times to count),<br>Hiroshima/Miyajima (2 times), Sapporo (2 times),<br>Kyoto/Osaka/Nara (I wish more than once), Hakodate City, Oga,<br>and Sendai/Matsushima. This does not include our frequent day<br>trips to sites and locations within a couple hours drive of Misawa.<br>We truly enjoyed the unique and exotic activities (snowshoeing),<br>sites (Big Buddha), sounds (flutes, cymbals and drums at the<br>Nebuta Festival), and smells (drying squid and seaweed).<br>(U) In our first 6 months in England, we have gotten off to a<br>relatively slow start as we have just driven to Edinburgh, northern<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.

Fear not, we are<br>planning trips to London, Paris/Normandy and Rome before the end<br>of this year. So far we have found that travel in Europe is<br>significantly cheaper than in Asia as a result of the explosion of<br>low-cost airlines in Europe.
