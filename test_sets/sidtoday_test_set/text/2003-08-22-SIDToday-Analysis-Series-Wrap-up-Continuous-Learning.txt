DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Analysis Series Wrap-up: Continuous Learning<br>FROM: Jack Israel,<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 08/22/2003<br><br>and Beth Walton<br><br>(U//FOUO) For the past four days we're presented new analytic<br>methodologies and techniques that are available to today's SIGINT<br>analyst, and you're probably wondering, what can I do to stay<br>abreast of these exciting new developments? What opportunities<br>are available to maintain my analytic proficiency? What you should<br>be aware of is the multitude of opportunities to grow and develop<br>as a SIGINT analyst.<br>(U//FOUO) SIGINT analysis isn't getting any easier, our targets are<br>becoming more sophisticated, they're taking advantage of<br>advanced communications technologies and finding new ways to<br>try to thwart us as SIGINT analysts. We must use these changes to<br>our benefit and not allow the volume, variety and velocity of data<br>flowing into NSA to be a liability. It is our job to maintain<br>proficiencies in advanced telecommunications technologies and<br>cultural awareness. We must continue to hone our basic analytic<br>skills, such as generating and evaluating competing hypotheses,<br>developing an awareness of analytic traps such as groupthink and<br>bias, performing metadata analysis, and engaging in collaborative<br>knowledge discovery. Target development skills such as Social<br>Network Analysis and Target Templating are vital to finding new<br>targets and maintaining continuity with the targets we already<br>know about.<br>(U//FOUO) All analysts have opportunities to advance their skill and<br>knowledge levels, whether in informal, on the job settings or in<br>formal training programs. Within the operational setting, analysts<br>can acquire knowledge and skills from debating, discussing and<br>collaborating with experts on operational problems, taking<br>advantage of mentoring programs, evaluating new techniques and<br>associated tools, and engaging in the discussion at A&amp;P;<br>Showcases , Advanced Analytic Seminars and Annual Conferences<br>. A&amp;P; also provides for more focused learning environments in<br>which analysts are protected from the press of daily operations joint SCAMPs (Summer Cryptanalysis Math Program) , specified<br>POD Research Programs sponsored by S3T, the AIRP (Analysis<br>Innovation Research Program) , and a new Advanced Analysis Lab<br>program beginning in FY04 - SEAS (Summers for Excellence in<br>Analysis Seminars). Informal learning is also supported 24/7 by<br>accessing the SIGDEVToday Learning Portal and the Analytic Best<br>Practices on WebWorld.<br>(U//FOUO) Since many of today's learning needs cut across<br>organizational boundaries and traditional skill field communities,<br>identifying gaps in skills and knowledge and matching them with<br>the most appropriate sources of learning is the joint responsibility<br>of each analyst, manager, technical director, and skill field<br>community expert. Formal training, provided by both the expert<br>analyst and by external training services, continues to evolve to<br>address the more structured skill and knowledge learning needs of<br>SID analysts and provides yet another venue for analysts to<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Analysis<br>1.
