Their aim was to<br>promote an interest in international events and affairs while providing unique insights into those<br>issues. That mission continues today, as the IAI routinely hosts speakers from classified and<br>unclassified arenas to lecture on hot topics in international affairs and encourages its members<br>to write and publish papers on related subjects.<br>(U//FOUO) The IAI employs many methods of raising awareness of international affairs. These<br>include annual events such as the International Challenge, which tests members and nonmembers on their international affairs trivia, a book sale featuring the latest and greatest in<br>international affairs literature, and an essay contest covering a range of subjects. All of these<br>endeavors are well received by employees and many also include cash prizes for the winners!<br>This year's challenge is scheduled for September 17.
