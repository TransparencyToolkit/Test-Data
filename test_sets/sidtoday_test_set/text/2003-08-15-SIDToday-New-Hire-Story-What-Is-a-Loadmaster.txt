DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) New Hire Story: What Is a Loadmaster?<br>FROM:<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 08/15/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: in a recent story we issued a call for interesting<br>anecdotes showing how new hires can be taken by surprise by the specialized jargon of their new<br>workplace. Today's article was submitted in response:<br>(U) My story goes back even before my civilian hiring process to my Air Force basic training,<br>during which I took a battery of tests that would be used to steer me into the appropriate career<br>field and follow-on training. I had, apparently, already passed some number of tests that<br>resulted in my being held at Lackland AFB in "casual status" waiting for orders to a school. The<br>daily routine was much less traumatic than basic training-- I didn't have to wake up until it was<br>actually daylight and I spent the work day doing whatever odd jobs needed doing around the<br>base: mess check, grass cutting, painting, etc.<br>(U) Meanwhile, some of my fellow airmen had orders to train as traffic analysts. I was quite<br>surprised to learn that the Air Force was involved in helping to solve traffic congestion problems<br>in cities. Finally, I had a note in the orderly room to report to the assignments section to get<br>"the word". The word turned out to be a choice: the tests said I was qualified to train as a<br>linguist or a loadmaster. My cynical side said, "The assignments section was working on jobs<br>beginning with the letter L."<br>(U) I didn't know anything about either career field and no one would tell me anything, except<br>that I had to make a decision by the next morning. That evening I was going through the chow<br>line behind a senior (two-striper) airman who had numerous bandages and a cast on his left leg.<br>As luck would have it, we sat at the same table and the conversation turned to "what happened<br>to you?" He said he routinely flew as a crew member on cargo aircraft into Viet Nam. While<br>waiting for return cargo, he was assigned as a spotter on a C-47 gunship (known to many as<br>"Puff the Magic Dragon"). On his last mission, ground fire wounded three of the crew. I asked<br>him what his career field was and he said, "Loadmaster." Thirty-eight years later, I still consider<br>this one of my better "HUMINT collection efforts".<br>, Contractor <br>(hired as a language intern after 4 years in the U.S. Air Force Security Service)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
