If, so, a unique opportunity awaits<br>you as a Counterterrorism (CT) subject matter expert supporting the Iraqi Survey Group (ISG)<br>in Baghdad! The ISG, led by CIA and DIA, is responsible for the immediate exploitation of<br>terrorist-related information and disruption of terrorist activities. Secondly, it handles the<br>Document Exploitation (DOCEX) mission within Iraq. Literally tons of material has been collected<br>throughout Iraq, both physical media and through interrogations. NSA supports this effort fully<br>and has committed to staff two analytic ISG positions in Baghdad. While the ISG does not have<br>a SIGINT mission, SIGINT analysts will look for SIGINT leads, provide reach-back into NSA<br>databases, and provide the SIGINT perspective to ISG operations. The CT analyst will deploy in<br>January 2004 for approximately 120 days.<br>(S) The selectee will, in all likelihood, be involved in the interrogation/questioning of potential<br>leads (there is no language requirement for this position), the evaluation and analysis of<br>interrogation reports and other HUMINT-based reports, and the review and evaluation of<br>captured documents and computer files in an attempt to identify and construct networks of who<br>the insurgents are, who they communicate with and, ultimately, their planning.<br>(S) After appropriate training, you will deploy to the Baghdad Survey Analysis Center, at the<br>Baghdad International Airport, home to several of Saddam's former Palaces. The living<br>conditions have improved significantly to include hot meals and adequate sleeping<br>accommodations.<br>(U//FOUO) Successful applicants, for the initial and follow-on deployments, will follow both NSA<br>TDY and DIA pre-deployment processing routines.

During the week you will receive Iraqi AOR-required uniforms and equipment,<br>weapons qualification training, and medical screening, to include all required immunizations.
