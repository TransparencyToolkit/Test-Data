DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) Dispatch from NIST Baghdad: Life in the Palace<br>FROM:<br>NIST Coalition Provisional Authority - Baghdad<br>Run Date: 07/30/2003<br><br>(U) Greetings from Baghdad!<br>(S//SI) The NSA contingent at the NIST (National Intelligence Support Team)-- based in a<br>former presidential palace in Baghdad-- provides one-stop-shopping for members of the<br>Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) who look to current intelligence from NSAW as they try to<br>understand the situation here on the ground in Iraq. As it stands now, the majority of<br>intelligence briefed to Ambassador Bremer and the senior staff is SIGINT. In addition to<br>providing the senior staff with our insights into the political and military reporting, we have<br>created topic-driven folders with relevant SIGINT. They have proved so popular that the CIA<br>officer in the NIST is now adding his product to the folders. All of this would not be possible<br>without the support of the deployed assets of AS24 who make sure that we have comms 99.3%<br>of the time! A truly team effort getting information to the customer, whether it's in the palace or<br>back home. All fit into 18-20 hours covered by two people.<br>(TS//SI) Team Baghdad is more than just the NSA staff at NIST CPA. NSA support extends to<br>5th Corps, the self-proclaimed CSG Baghdad, Task Force-20, HVT (High Value Targets), SCS<br>(Special Collection Service), and Musketeer. While we try to maintain an awareness of issues<br>that involve all of us, we also get together for a weekly meeting out at Baghdad International<br>Airport (BIAP). It also has proven to be a useful tool to speak with one voice about concerns to<br>NSAW.<br>(S) You may think from the postcards at the Al Rashid Hotel that we are at vacation central. We<br>are not. When going off the palace compound we all wear body armor and carry a Baretta and/or<br>a rifle. When we travel to BIAP for our weekly meeting, we go out fully armed and in a convoy of<br>two vehicles. Since this is known as the "world's most dangerous road" we try to spend as little<br>time on it as possible. That means not staying in the same place for any period of time and<br>pushing our Chevy Suburban to 110 mph.<br>(S) As far as living goes, the palace grounds have become a self-contained American city. We<br>live in a trailer park in the back of the palace, which we share with a former US Ambassador and<br>a retired British officer from SIS. The trailer has two rooms with a bathroom in the middle.<br>Three hot meals are available everyday of the week. Some think the meals are horrible but<br>when you have to feed 3,000 people three times a day the level of culinary excellence will suffer.<br>Where else can you relive your elementary school cafeteria? The bad news is that we suffer a<br>little more intestinal discomfort then we did as youngsters.<br>(S//SI) All in all, it's a once in a lifetime experience. Where else can you play whiffle ball to the<br>sound of gunfire in the distance? Where else can you see that on a daily basis SIGINT is doing<br>its job to provide US civilian and military leadership the information they need to do their jobs?<br>Not many places.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
