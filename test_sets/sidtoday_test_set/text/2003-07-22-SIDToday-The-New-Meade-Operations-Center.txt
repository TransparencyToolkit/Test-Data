Over the past 5 months,<br>a major effort on the part of SID, Extended Enterprise<br>Management, and the Service Cryptologic Elements (SCEs) has laid<br>the groundwork and started the transition of the National SIGINT<br>Collection Center (NSCC) into the Meade Operations Center (MOC).<br>The driving forces behind this transformation were the<br>fragmentation over time of the tasks performed in the NSCC, to<br>the extent that it had lost its identity; the lack of a clearly<br>identified strategy on the NSCC's role and position in the SIGINT<br>Enterprise, and plans by the SCEs to reallocate personnel<br>resources from the NSCC into Transformation areas.<br>(S//SI) The Director's vision of the MOC is a capabilities-based,<br>collection-focused element with specific responsibility for exploiting<br>midpoint access, both RF and cable. The MOC has ceased collection<br>of many legacy targets determined at a corporate level to be either<br>of little value, or duplicated elsewhere. This has allowed the MOC<br>to devote its remaining personnel and resources to new SIGINT<br>Development tasks with a trans-national emphasis.<br>(U//FOUO) To find out more about these tasks and how the MOC is<br>set up to accomplish them, click HERE .<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Data<br>Acquisition<br>1.
