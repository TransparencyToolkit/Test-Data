"Tough Times for<br>Turkey" will be presented by the Deputy SINIO for Europe, <br>, on Thursday, 12 June<br>from 10:30 to 12:30 in Room 2B4118-6 . Advance registration is required; click HERE for<br>instructions.<br>Course Overview:<br>(C) The fallout from the Iraqi campaign has been largely negative for Turkey, and the full impact<br>of this very bitter episode in U.S.- Turkish relations is still unknown. The pro-Islam Justice and<br>Development Party (AKP) and the Turkish General Staff (TGS), guardian of Turkey's secular<br>democracy, view each other with mutual suspicion. The strategic relationship with the U.S. is<br>seriously weakened, so the U.S. is unlikely to champion Turkey's cause in Europe or with the<br>IMF/World Bank as fervently. In addition, Turkey's regional influence, particularly in northern<br>Iraq, has been significantly diminished. The presentation will examine the impact that major<br>differences in expectations, perceptions, threat definition, decisionmaking, and communication<br>had on the strategic relationship and assess the likely long-term impact.<br>(U//FOUO) Please consult the SINIO Website ("go sinio") for information on future events in this<br>series.<br>POCs: <br><br>, for SINIO Council (<br> for NCS <br>and <br> (<br><br>) <br><br>) <br>) for information on current presentation.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
