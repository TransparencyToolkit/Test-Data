As MG Quirk's executive assistant, this is one<br>(U) A Day in the Life of...<br>of the many dramatic opening lines that I've heard. An exec is a<br>senior leader's front door, traffic cop, information manager, and<br>most importantly, conscience. Like triage in an emergency room,<br>1.

An exec is a confidant who works<br>significant and sensitive issues behind the scenes. They are the<br>senior's staunchest ally to the outside world but privately their<br>toughest critic providing candid assessments of decisions,<br>meetings, and briefings. The exec represents the senior at all times<br>and must build positive relationships across the organization,<br>particularly with the staffs of other senior leaders. An exec makes<br>sure promises are kept and questions are answered. An exec is the<br>voice inside the senior's head reminding them of their priorities and<br>obligations.<br>(U//FOUO) So the hours are long and the pace is relentless-- why<br>would anyone want to do this? Immersion into this job provides<br>one of the purest training experiences. An exec has a front row seat<br>to the good, the bad, and the ugly of the senior leadership lifestyle.<br>Most execs serve for a limited duration (12 to 24 months is<br>typical)-- long enough to learn the job and be effective, but short<br>enough to maintain sanity. Whether they aspire to be a senior or<br>just more effective at their current level, executive assistants<br>return to the workforce with a much-improved understanding of<br>the implications of their work as part of the big picture.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
