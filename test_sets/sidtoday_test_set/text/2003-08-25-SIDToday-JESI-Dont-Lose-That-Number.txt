What<br>SIGINT Cooperation<br>is JESI, and why should you care? First, the definition: JESI is a<br>"multi-national executive body responsible for ensuring continued<br>interaction and interoperability among the five SIGINT partners."<br>1.  SIGINT Directors Set<br>Notice that it is an "executive body" - this means that it does not<br>Strategic Direction<br>have a dedicated staff. There are leads for various efforts, but<br>for 5-Eyes SIGINT<br>essentially JESI is you and I! Now to the second part: why should<br>Enterprise<br>you care? ...Because JESI is trying to make it easier for all of the<br>2.  Communications<br>Second Parties to collaborate on producing SIGINT, and to<br>Security<br>exchange information in general.<br>Establishment (CSE)<br>- Our Good Neighbor<br>(U//FOUO) Although NSA has had bilateral relationships with<br>to the North<br>individual Second Party countries going back to the 1940's and<br>3.  JESI: Don't Lose<br>1950's, we did not have any group (5-EYES) partnership until<br>That Number!<br>1993. JESI was formed in 1998 to bring structure to our<br>4.  How SIGINT's Done<br>interactions and to provide a SIGINT operational focus to our<br>Down Under!<br>dealings. Since then, it has developed a structure enabling us to<br>5.

SID 's Antipodal<br>additional NSA representatives lead specific JESI functions.<br>Colleagues<br>7.  TICKETWINDOW:<br>(S//SI) So what has JESI accomplished? Our efforts have really<br>Second Party<br>been picking up steam, especially in the last year:<br>Collection Sharing<br>8.  The Kiwi Connection<br>InfoWorkSpace (IWS) was deployed as a collaboration tool<br>- Fellowship of the<br>that was used to exchange information among NSA, the<br>Ring?<br>U.S. military, and partner countries during Operation<br>Enduring Freedom.<br>MAINWAY, a system that uses phone call contact chaining<br>to identify targets of interest, was provided to each of our<br>partners. The partners now supply additional contact<br>information to the database to enhance our joint ability to<br>identify targets.<br>JESI has pushed the agencies to deploy an interoperable<br>public key security infrastructure (PKI) , to enable the<br>exchange of certificates among all partners. (Yes, you have<br>JESI to thank for the switch from ICARUS to PKI...)<br>NSA has been cooperating with CSE on a prototype of a<br>system to deliver SIGINT on Demand to customers. NSA is<br>forwarding SIGINT data to the CSE SLINGSHOT system,<br>which delivers end product to their customers. CSE has<br>established CATAPULT , into which they deliver 5-EYES end<br>product.<br>Several protected web sites have been established to allow<br>Second Party partners to share data securely within their<br>community of interest.<br><br>...not bad!<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(C) The meeting in Canberra in July focused on our mission<br>objectives and how they relate to the recently published 5-EYES<br>SIGINT Partnership Business Vision . We addressed: 1) mission<br>collaboration and knowledge sharing; 2) enabling SIGINT<br>operations through information assurance; 3) exchange of finished<br>intelligence; and 4) maintaining business continuity.<br>(U//FOUO) I hope this gives you a sense of what JESI is all about.<br>With your participation, JESI will continue to make it easier for us<br>to collaborate with our Second Party partners to produce the best<br>possible SIGINT.
