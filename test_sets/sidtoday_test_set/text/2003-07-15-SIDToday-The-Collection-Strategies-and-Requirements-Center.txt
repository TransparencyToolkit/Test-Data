DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center<br>FROM:<br>Deputy Director for Data Acquisition<br>Run Date: 07/15/2003<br><br>(TS//SI) The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center<br>(CSRC) serves as the "front door" for Data Acquisition and works<br>closely with Customer Relationships, Analysis and Production, and<br>the Extended Enterprise to ensure that a comprehensive crossprogram collection perspective is taken as NSA works to meet its<br>customers' needs. The CSRC was originally formed as part of the<br>creation of SID in February 2001, but really came to fruition post<br>9-11-2001. At that time the Deputy Director for Data Acquisition<br>surged dozens of people to the CSRC with the goal of having the<br>organization be the focal point for the orchestration of Data<br>Acquisition activities in response to the crisis. With the military<br>action in Iraq the CSRC has performed this "crisis" function again<br>as the Functional Lead for Collection Issues and operator of the<br>Data Acquisition Iraq Watch.<br>(TS//SI) The CSRC has three primary functions - daily<br>orchestration of the access, collection and exploitation system;<br>development of overarching data acquisition strategies in<br>accordance with the SID Operating Principles; and management,<br>monitoring, and troubleshooting of SID data flows.<br>(TS//SI) The Current Operations Division within the CSRC<br>evaluates daily collection requirements and, based on the target<br>communications being used and their vulnerabilities, assigns them<br>to appropriate collectors for action. They also work closely with the<br>Second Parties to ensure that we are effectively partnering on a<br>broad range of issues, to include the TICKETWINDOW sensitive<br>source sharing agreement. Additionally, this division provides<br>direct 24/7 connectivity between NSA and a critical Third Party<br>partner, targeting and compliance support to ensure effective<br>selector management, and supports the Senior Collection Officer<br>(SCO) desk in NSOC.<br>(TS//SI) The CSRC is a strong proponent of the SID Operating<br>Principles , using them as the methodology for the development of<br>strategies in the Strategy Development Division. In partnership<br>with subject matter experts from Analysis &amp; Production and<br>Customer Relationships, the CSRC shapes and assembles SID-level<br>comprehensive strategies on high-priority targets or issues. In this<br>construct, Customer Relationships analyzes the customers'<br>information needs and provides both Analysis &amp; Production and<br>Data Acquisition a thorough assessment of these needs. Analysis &amp;<br>Production develops the analytic attack and the social networks of<br>a target of interest. The SIGINT Development organization<br>provides an assessment of the physical and logical networks<br>associated with the targets social networks. From this the CSRC<br>can determine where communications might be vulnerable, the<br>appropriate sensors for collection, any gaps and shortfalls, and<br>collection and exploitation capabilities that need to be developed<br>and deployed.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Data<br>Acquisition<br>1.  Welcome to SID's<br>Data Acquisition<br>Directorate<br>2.  The Collection<br>Strategies and<br>Requirements Center<br>3.

The New Meade<br>Operations Center<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(TS//SI) In December 2001 ITIS and SID jointly conducted a study<br>to determine the most effective manner, organizationally, to<br>manage and monitor SIGINT data flow. At that time the Data Flow<br>organization was moved from ITIS to SID to improve the<br>effectiveness and efficiency of the SIGINT data flow management<br>process and to couple it more closely with related functions. This<br>"tweaking," following the February 2001 reorganization, has been<br>very successful, enabling the CSRC to have the end-to-end mission<br>management picture from collection requirement to delivery of<br>data to an analyst/linguist for use. Management of data flow has<br>allowed the CSRC to develop effectiveness and efficiency measures<br>that will influence how mission management is done in the future.<br>(TS//SI) The CSRC served as the focal point for Data Acquisition<br>for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The CSRC ran a 24/7 shop manned by<br>personnel throughout Data Acquisition. The CSRC also had<br>individuals deployed to GRSOC, CENTCOM, and in-theater at<br>Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) in Kuwait.<br>Additionally, the CSRC has been the operational lead for the<br>development of CMM's Focused Demonstration for Iraq. The<br>Focused Demonstration is a key step in the development of CMM,<br>providing the CSRC, and ultimately other organizations, with the<br>ability to understand NSA's collection posture against a particular<br>target in a matter of minutes rather than the hours or even days it<br>can take now. The CSRC will continue to partner with CMM to<br>develop follow on projects that will present data in such a way that<br>will improve the timeliness of mission management decision<br>making.<br>(U//FOUO) The CSRC front office can be reached at <br>in<br>room 5A119.
