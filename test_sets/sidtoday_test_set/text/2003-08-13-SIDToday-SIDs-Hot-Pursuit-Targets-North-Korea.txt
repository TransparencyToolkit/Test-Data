DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) SID's 'Hot Pursuit' Targets North Korea<br>FROM:<br>Asia Target Analysis<br>Run Date: 08/13/2003<br><br>(S//SI) The Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Group and its predecessors have a long history of<br>analytic effort against the North Korean target, both from a cryptanalytic and a signals analytic<br>perspective. Though there have been notable successes, often the story has been one of much<br>hard work and frustratingly little payoff: either the communications of highest interest have<br>been difficult to access or, if they were accessible, they have been protected by intractable<br>encryption. From the NSA position as "interloper", the North Korean method of operation with<br>regard to its communications has been successful due not as much to sophisticated technology<br>as to its stringent implementation of tried and true techniques carried out with almost unrivaled<br>operations security.<br>(S//SI) Since February of this year, the Office of Target Pursuit has redoubled its effort to focus<br>not only its own resources against North Korea but also to join together with other stakeholders<br>of the target within SID. This renewed effort has taken the form of a so-called "Hot Pursuit",<br>employing the idea implemented for the Iraq conflict as a model and embodied by a group<br>representing a wide range of disciplines, including cryptanalysis, signals analysis, collection,<br>target reconnaissance and survey, special access, network exploitation, SIGDEV, and<br>reporting/intelligence analysis. The group has been meeting regularly to cooperate in the<br>building of plans for prosecuting the North Korean target in the most productive manner. Though<br>Target Pursuit is spearheading this effort with the goal of maximizing the use of its own<br>resources, it and other offices with a North Korean focus are correlating their work and the<br>ensuing results.<br>(S//SI) The Hot Pursuit group began its work in a "data gathering" mode. This included the<br>development of a signals environment baseline. An evaluation of the baseline and the priorities<br>and requirements associated with those signals led to the selection of a short list of signals or<br>topics considered to be of highest importance, i.e., those which, if exploited, would produce the<br>largest intelligence gains against the target. Though the group has considered the target as a<br>whole, its emphasis has been on military communications. Subsequently, target experts<br>composed strategy papers outlining SID's status against the given subject and associated gaps<br>and goals for filling the gaps. The group established a website as a repository for this and<br>related information, at the TS//SI level.<br>(S//SI) The group made a transition from data gathering mode to completing the strategies and<br>implementing them during an all-day meeting on 26 June and a follow-up meeting on 1 July.<br>During these meetings, a subset of the community Hot Pursuit group reviewed and discussed<br>the chosen topics, adding more detail to the strategies and assigning actions for bridging the<br>identified gaps. OpSIGINT has been involved in the process from the start and is helping to<br>complete the action items resulting from the strategy session.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
