DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) New Release: The FORNSAT Plan<br>FROM:<br>Technical Director for FORNSAT<br>Run Date: 06/03/2003<br><br>(TS//SI) This isn't your Grandfather's FORNSAT Plan! For over 30 years, the collection and<br>processing of international communications from foreign communications satellites (FORNSAT)<br>has been part of NSA's balanced collection program. To maintain that balance, FORNSAT<br>Program has planned a vigorous modernization. The FORNSAT Plan probes the current<br>intelligence value of the FORNSAT program vis-a-vis the commercial satellite business plans for<br>launches, services and customers. Then it lays out the current technical capability, pointing out<br>the current and future needs and prioritizing the system gaps. These gaps form the basis for the<br>proposed modernization. It's no surprise that the FORNSAT system is in a dire need of upgrade<br>to exploit the technology already introduced to the commercial industry--technology that is<br>being used today by important intelligence targets, i.e. mobile satellite phones, digital video<br>broadcast over satellite, private satellite networks, etc.<br>(TS//SI) Major thrusts of this plan begin with the need for a wholesale change in the FORNSAT<br>architecture. The last major upgrade for the program was Trans World Digital (TWD) in the mid90s. TWD targeted long-haul international circuit-switched telephony and was designed before<br>the Internet boom. Bottom-line is that the current architecture, primarily engineered for voice<br>traffic, is trying to support high data-rate DNI carriers. The second major thrust is in the area of<br>Mobile Satellite Services (Thuraya, ACeS, Inmarsat and others). These service providers<br>illuminate their coverage areas through the use of hundreds of spot beams. Our 13 fixed<br>FORNSAT sites cannot provide the necessary access; the plan presents a number of options,<br>including relying on our covert partners to provide the required points of presence. Lastly, the<br>Plan proposes ways to improve FORNSAT's SIGINT Development capabilities. Initiatives range<br>from providing additional resources, to the concept of the "Virtual Analyst"--leveraging the<br>various Signals Development Centers to provide signals analysis support to our covert partners.<br>(TS//SI) For over 30 years, FORNSAT has provided timely and significant information on a wide<br>variety of intelligence topics that by their nature flow across national boundaries. This access has<br>delivered transit traffic about terrorists, international crime, weapons of mass destruction,<br>proliferation, arms control, international finance and trade, not to mention the intelligence<br>derived from diplomatic communications, private commercial networks, airline reservations and<br>billing data. The flexible architecture of the FORNSAT system has allowed NSA to fine-tune<br>collection and processing and locate information relevant to the most current intelligence needs.<br>For this reason, FORNSAT has consistently provided the information used in over 25% of end<br>product reporting year after year. And a careful implementation of the FORNSAT Plan will ensure<br>this trend to continue for many years to come.<br>(S//SI) For further information on the FORNSAT Plan, check out the FORNSAT Division web page<br>.
