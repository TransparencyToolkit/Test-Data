Did you work at a<br>restaurant? Hang out on the beach? Work in an office? Go to summer school? Take a trip? For<br>about 20 students a year, the answer is, "I worked at NSA!"<br>(S) NSA has developed an Intelligence Analyst Summer Intern Program. Students from all over<br>the country have found out about this program, applied, and earned the opportunity to spend<br>three months working at the Agency gaining exposure to many facets of the intelligence field.<br>The program is designed to attract people with academic backgrounds to the Agency and to give<br>them a chance to get a taste for the mission. For the three months, the students attend<br>briefings, go on tours, and meet with people from their respective targets of interest. In addition,<br>the students are responsible for two different projects. One is a research project which involves<br>the use of software like Anchory and Plus. The second project is a Digital Network Intelligence<br>(DNI) project which introduces them to network exploitation and other technical elements used<br>for the mission.<br>(U//FOUO) Prospective attendants must fill out an application and complete a full background<br>investigation prior to acceptance. Selected interns are then invited to participate in the program,<br>the benefits of which include a GG-6 or GG-7 salary, the ability to earn sick leave and annual<br>leave, and a stated conditional offer for future employment if successful completion of the<br>program and their academic career ensues. After interviewing several students who participated<br>in the program and have now joined NSA as full-time employees, the success of the program<br>seems clear. They all enjoyed the program immensely and would highly recommend it to others.<br>One woman stated that the program "was ultimately the reason I chose to return to the Agency<br>after graduation."<br>(U) It is important to note that NSA is casting a fairly filtered net with this program. There is not<br>an extensive advertising campaign to promote this program; rather this program serves to<br>compete with similar programs at other intelligence agencies. CIA, DIA, and NIMA all have<br>summer programs designed to entice students to accept employment after graduation. Students<br>have learned about the programs via specific courses or departments at their universities. One<br>student learned about it through an international security studies program, another through the<br>Monterey Institute of International Studies, and another by simply logging on to the NSA<br>website on his own volition. Thus, with this program, NSA is gaining students whose interest is<br>already sparked when it comes to the Intelligence Community. The program seems to provide a<br>well choreographed symbiotic relationship: students interested in intelligence get a head start on<br>a career in their desired field, and NSA gets employees who are bright, motivated, and<br>committed to the intelligence mission.<br>(U) SID Today note: Watch for a future article describing what the summer interns contributed<br>to the mission while working in SID.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
