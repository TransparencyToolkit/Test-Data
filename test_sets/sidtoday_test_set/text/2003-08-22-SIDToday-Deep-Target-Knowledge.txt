Analysts often overlook the<br>importance of understanding the psychology and culture of their<br>target. They may erroneously allow themselves to categorize<br>certain scenarios or actions as "unthinkable".<br>(C//SI) One way of avoiding such failures of imagination is to<br>operate, to the maximum extent possible, inside our target's<br>Conceptual Space. This is not to be confused with the target's<br>Information Space, which has come to mean the target's systems<br>of communicating and storing information and their content. The<br>Information Space is tied to the target's technology and is, in fact,<br>what we as SIGINT analysts target and collect against.<br>(C//SI) The target's Conceptual Space on the other hand is the<br>entirety of his frame of reference - its culture (social, religious,<br>ethnic, national, organizational) and, at the level of the individual,<br>its personality. To try to operate within the target's Conceptual<br>Space is to try to live inside its head, to understand enough about<br>it and its milieu that we have a good sense of what it means, what<br>it is capable of doing, and how it should react. This has little, if<br>anything, to do with technology or what we collect and everything<br>to do with how we assess what we have collected and the context<br>into which we put it for our readers.<br>(C//SI) The objective is to be able to understand the target's<br>communications and documents as their originators did and as<br>their intended recipients were to have understood them. Clearly<br>that requires having knowledge of the subject domain (nuclear<br>physics, trade, avionics, etc). But it also requires a deep<br>understanding of the relevant cultural context (national, religious<br>or ideological, ministerial, professional, etc, and their various<br>permutations). The key to understanding that cultural context is<br>command of the relevant language(s), both at the general and the<br>culture-specific level. Vocabulary can, and often does, have more<br>than denotative value; it can carry culture-bound baggage that<br>elicits a predictable emotional response from the cultural insider.<br>For the intelligence analyst, "getting" the cultural reference is often<br>critical to fully understanding what is going on. Unfortunately,<br>there are any number of examples of analysts in the Intelligence<br>Community coming to erroneous conclusions because they lacked<br>sufficient language and target depth to understand material,<br>actions, or events within the proper cultural framework.<br>(C//SI) Once an analyst has the skills and knowledge to operate<br>inside their target's Conceptual Space, gaining access to the<br>target's Information Space, particularly its private Information<br>Space, can lead to a virtuous circle where access to the<br>Information Space improves the analyst's knowledge of the<br>Conceptual Space, further increasing the ability to exploit what is<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Analysis<br>1.
