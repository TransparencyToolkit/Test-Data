DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Airborne SIGINT Engineering Integrated Product Team Part II<br>FROM:<br>National Tactical Integration Office<br>Run Date: 10/08/2003<br>(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: This is the conclusion of a two-part article.<br>(U//FOUO) The ASEIPT has also worked with industry leaders in examining Open System<br>Architecture approaches, which emphasize cross-platform re-usability and interoperability while<br>minimizing non-recurring engineering costs. The unanimous message/theme from industry was<br>the need for a common standardized application interface/middleware to facilitate horizontal<br>integration and interoperability of core SIGINT functions as well as facilitate advanced technology<br>insertion into all platforms.<br>(U//FOUO) As a first step in defining and developing this common interface, the ASEIPT<br>members agreed to work with the MIDAS (Multi-User Interactive Development and Analysis<br>Software - a portable, networked, interactive environment for software signal processing and<br>analysis) community to integrate MIDAS applications into their systems. Today, MIDAS<br>applications are used sporadically across airborne platforms but are not truly "integrated" into<br>the core SIGINT system(s) (usually they are a QRC/laptop type installation onto the platforms).<br>The ASEIPT is currently formalizing a working relationship with the National Reconnaissance<br>Office's (NRO) MIDAS PMO to jointly develop and demonstrate this common application<br>interface/middleware. The Air Force's Rivet Joint (RC-135) SIGINT aircraft has been designated<br>to be the test platform for this effort in FY-04 and the other airborne SIGINT platforms will be<br>involved during the interface definition and development phase.<br>(U//FOUO) The lessons learned from the Rivet Joint's integration effort will assist in extending<br>this common application interface/middleware to the other platforms. This migration is expected<br>to reduce the costs of integrating future capabilities and reduce development costs by leveraging<br>off the extensive MIDAS SIGINT functionality (non-proprietary, GOTS applications) and structure<br>already in existence. It is anticipated that the technical interface definitions/descriptions for the<br>application interface will be documented in the community's Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture<br>(JASA), developed and coordinated for the airborne SIGINT community by NSA's National<br>Tactical Integration Office (NTIO).<br>(U//FOUO) The ASEIPT also sponsors an airborne SIGINT Technology Conference every year.<br>The purpose of this conference is for the various services/programs to showcase their new<br>capabilities to be available to other airborne platforms within 18 months. The next conference<br>will be held 8-12 December 2003 in Greenville, TX. The point of contact for the conference is <br>, S141, <br>.<br>(U//FOUO) The ASEIPT is striving towards and enabling true collaboration across the tactical<br>airborne SIGINT community with the emphasis on re-usability and interoperability. Together, we<br>can achieve a joint tactical airborne SIGINT environment with the engineering solutions to<br>satisfy today's and tomorrows most pressing requirements.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
