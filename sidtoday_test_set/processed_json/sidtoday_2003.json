We hope that this series engenders questions,<br>suggestions and interactions that will infuse SID's continued<br>transformation.<br>(S//SI) The core of our customer relationships is understanding<br>and meeting our customers' Information Needs. Those needs, as<br>you all know, are myriad. Working in the SID is a challenge since<br>meeting customer needs means defending the nation, supporting<br>the campaign against terrorism, and providing vital support to<br>warfighters under fire in Iraq and to the National Policy Makers who<br>must now engage in Iraq's reconstruction. Meeting customer needs<br>also means both maintaining coverage on other national SIGINT<br>priorities, such as the continuing crisis in North Korea, and<br>enduring strategic issues, such as Weapons of Mass Destruction.<br>That challenge is being met successfully today through hard work,<br>innovation, partnership, and Information Needs (IN) management,<br>all of which combine to produce cohesive, positive outcomes. That<br>coordinated effort will be demonstrated in our five-part series.<br>(S//SI) The war in Iraq has presented a prism through which we<br>have been able to view the effectiveness of our planning,<br>programs, and relationships. Central to our strategy are our efforts<br>to make customers more active participants in the SIGINT system<br>by giving them the ability to see into and influence USCS activities.<br>The next article in this series (i.e. the second) on the National<br>SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) will describe the orderly flow<br>of Information Needs during the war. In terms of success, you may<br>compare the present manageable flow of Information Needs to that<br>of the days, weeks, and months following 11 September 2001<br>when INs under the former RFI system increased by over 1,000<br>percent, threatening to overwhelm intelligence production.<br>(S//SI) CRD's strategic thinking and customer interaction are<br>aimed at a deeper understanding of customer needs. They are also<br>coupled with creativity and innovation to engender the interaction<br>of decision makers, warfighters and IC partners with SIGINT in new<br>ways--and sometimes with new customers.

We hope that this series engenders questions,suggestions and interactions that will infuse SID's continuedtransformation.(S//SI) The core of our customer relationships is understandingand meeting our customers' Information Needs. Those needs, asyou all know, are myriad. Working in the SID is a challenge sincemeeting customer needs means defending the nation, supportingthe campaign against terrorism, and providing vital support towarfighters under fire in Iraq and to the National Policy Makers whomust now engage in Iraq's reconstruction. Meeting customer needsalso means both maintaining coverage on other national SIGINTpriorities, such as the continuing crisis in North Korea, andenduring strategic issues, such as Weapons of Mass Destruction.That challenge is being met successfully today through hard work,innovation, partnership, and Information Needs (IN) management,all of which combine to produce cohesive, positive outcomes. Thatcoordinated effort will be demonstrated in our five-part series.(S//SI) The war in Iraq has presented a prism through which wehave been able to view the effectiveness of our planning,programs, and relationships. Central to our strategy are our effortsto make customers more active participants in the SIGINT systemby giving them the ability to see into and influence USCS activities.The next article in this series (i.e. the second) on the NationalSIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) will describe the orderly flowof Information Needs during the war. In terms of success, you maycompare the present manageable flow of Information Needs to thatof the days, weeks, and months following 11 September 2001when INs under the former RFI system increased by over 1,000percent, threatening to overwhelm intelligence production.(S//SI) CRD's strategic thinking and customer interaction areaimed at a deeper understanding of customer needs. They are alsocoupled with creativity and innovation to engender the interactionof decision makers, warfighters and IC partners with SIGINT in newways--and sometimes with new customers. The third article willshowcase both new customers, like U.S. Northern Command(NORTHCOM) and the Missile Defense Agency, as well as new waysof interacting with major customers to deliver SIGINT into thecustomers' information space that is secure, usable, accessible andtimely.(S//SI) In the fourth article, you will have the opportunity to reada Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) perspective from U.S.United Nations (USUN) SEAM and her SEAM Teamwho are the models of customer relationship management. TheSEAM Team has transformed that relationship from a transactional SERIES: (U) Customer Relations1.  When MeetingCustomer NeedsMeans Defending theNation2.

Our Director, Lt Gen Hayden, supports NSA's participation in this<br>effort initiated by Mark Lowenthal, ADCI/AP (Assistant DCI for Analysis and Production). S2 will<br>be the first organization to provide data to the ARC, but eventually all analysts throughout the<br>NSA extended enterprise will be included in the database .<br>(U//FOUO) The datacalls will be conducted by the DANCEHALL Team using a tool called the<br>Cryptologic Volunteer Application (CVA). Simply entering data via CVA does not indicate,<br>however, that an employee is volunteering for a new placement or will be subjected to an<br>involuntary directed assignment solely on the basis of the skills information provided. Individuals<br>who would like to be considered for a move should follow the procedures described in the<br>Cryptologic Vacancy Application process to volunteer for a specific position. Likewise, we have<br>the assurance of the ADCI/AP that the ARC will not be used to locate mission experts within<br>individual Intelligence Community (IC) agencies for involuntary deployment.<br>(U//FOUO) The DANCEHALL team will notify individual Product Lines when each is to begin<br>participating in the inventory. At that time, all members of the product line will be provided with<br>working aids and contact information for DANCEHALL team members, should additional<br>assistance be required. The amount of time required varies depending on the breadth of target<br>expertise, but it is estimated that an average of 30 minutes of mission time per person is<br>required to complete the professional skills inventory. The accuracy, integrity, and thoroughness<br>of your responses are essential to conveying an appropriate picture of mission health within NSA<br>and the analytic capabilities of the IC. The ARC's mission areas for analytic expertise are aligned<br>to the 30 new National Intelligence Priority Framework issues from NSPD-26. Because data<br>collected on the expertise and experience of our workforce are also being applied to internal<br>mission management processes, including the S2 mission posture and ongoing efforts to<br>quantify and redress the JCS Intelligence Analysis Joint Monthly Readiness Review (JMRR)<br>deficiency, the survey must be completed by 100% of the workforce.<br>(U//FOUO) The Office of China and Korea (S2B) piloted the collection of data for the ARC in<br>early 2003. Their participation resulted in many improvements to CVA.

Our Director, Lt Gen Hayden, supports NSA's participation in thiseffort initiated by Mark Lowenthal, ADCI/AP (Assistant DCI for Analysis and Production). S2 willbe the first organization to provide data to the ARC, but eventually all analysts throughout theNSA extended enterprise will be included in the database .(U//FOUO) The datacalls will be conducted by the DANCEHALL Team using a tool called theCryptologic Volunteer Application (CVA). Simply entering data via CVA does not indicate,however, that an employee is volunteering for a new placement or will be subjected to aninvoluntary directed assignment solely on the basis of the skills information provided. Individualswho would like to be considered for a move should follow the procedures described in theCryptologic Vacancy Application process to volunteer for a specific position. Likewise, we havethe assurance of the ADCI/AP that the ARC will not be used to locate mission experts withinindividual Intelligence Community (IC) agencies for involuntary deployment.(U//FOUO) The DANCEHALL team will notify individual Product Lines when each is to beginparticipating in the inventory. At that time, all members of the product line will be provided withworking aids and contact information for DANCEHALL team members, should additionalassistance be required. The amount of time required varies depending on the breadth of targetexpertise, but it is estimated that an average of 30 minutes of mission time per person isrequired to complete the professional skills inventory. The accuracy, integrity, and thoroughnessof your responses are essential to conveying an appropriate picture of mission health within NSAand the analytic capabilities of the IC. The ARC's mission areas for analytic expertise are alignedto the 30 new National Intelligence Priority Framework issues from NSPD-26. Because datacollected on the expertise and experience of our workforce are also being applied to internalmission management processes, including the S2 mission posture and ongoing efforts toquantify and redress the JCS Intelligence Analysis Joint Monthly Readiness Review (JMRR)deficiency, the survey must be completed by 100% of the workforce.(U//FOUO) The Office of China and Korea (S2B) piloted the collection of data for the ARC inearly 2003. Their participation resulted in many improvements to CVA. The pilot also benefittedS2B: DANCEHALL Team partners in Operations Research Modeling and Simulation will use theinput data to provide S2B management with mathematical modeling for technical healthassessments, gap analysis and resource optimization proposals.(U) The DANCEHALL team and ARC developers thank you in advance for your participation andcooperation.

For over 30 years, the collection and<br>processing of international communications from foreign communications satellites (FORNSAT)<br>has been part of NSA's balanced collection program. To maintain that balance, FORNSAT<br>Program has planned a vigorous modernization. The FORNSAT Plan probes the current<br>intelligence value of the FORNSAT program vis-a-vis the commercial satellite business plans for<br>launches, services and customers. Then it lays out the current technical capability, pointing out<br>the current and future needs and prioritizing the system gaps. These gaps form the basis for the<br>proposed modernization. It's no surprise that the FORNSAT system is in a dire need of upgrade<br>to exploit the technology already introduced to the commercial industry--technology that is<br>being used today by important intelligence targets, i.e. mobile satellite phones, digital video<br>broadcast over satellite, private satellite networks, etc.<br>(TS//SI) Major thrusts of this plan begin with the need for a wholesale change in the FORNSAT<br>architecture. The last major upgrade for the program was Trans World Digital (TWD) in the mid90s. TWD targeted long-haul international circuit-switched telephony and was designed before<br>the Internet boom. Bottom-line is that the current architecture, primarily engineered for voice<br>traffic, is trying to support high data-rate DNI carriers. The second major thrust is in the area of<br>Mobile Satellite Services (Thuraya, ACeS, Inmarsat and others). These service providers<br>illuminate their coverage areas through the use of hundreds of spot beams. Our 13 fixed<br>FORNSAT sites cannot provide the necessary access; the plan presents a number of options,<br>including relying on our covert partners to provide the required points of presence. Lastly, the<br>Plan proposes ways to improve FORNSAT's SIGINT Development capabilities. Initiatives range<br>from providing additional resources, to the concept of the \"Virtual Analyst\"--leveraging the<br>various Signals Development Centers to provide signals analysis support to our covert partners.<br>(TS//SI) For over 30 years, FORNSAT has provided timely and significant information on a wide<br>variety of intelligence topics that by their nature flow across national boundaries. This access has<br>delivered transit traffic about terrorists, international crime, weapons of mass destruction,<br>proliferation, arms control, international finance and trade, not to mention the intelligence<br>derived from diplomatic communications, private commercial networks, airline reservations and<br>billing data. The flexible architecture of the FORNSAT system has allowed NSA to fine-tune<br>collection and processing and locate information relevant to the most current intelligence needs.<br>For this reason, FORNSAT has consistently provided the information used in over 25% of end<br>product reporting year after year.

The \"registration\" of your<br>name and SSN in SEARCHLIGHT (for those of you whose SEARCHLIGHT records are marked<br>\"confirmed\") originated in the HR CONCERTO.

Smith\".<br>(U//FOUO) ...ENTER THE PKI CERTIFICATE:<br>(U//FOUO) A required part of creating the PKI certificate, which is used to electronically identify<br>you, is the inclusion of your full name. Because your PKI will be used for identification in<br>electronic systems and exchanges (such as e-mail), the corporate directory system,<br>SEARCHLIGHT, must now have you registered with your full name. Part of your PKI certificate<br>also includes your security credentials and the official source of this information is SECURITY<br>CONCERTO. To get your PKI certificate, your full name must be in SEARCHLIGHT and must<br>match your full name in SECURITY CONCERTO. So, in order to get a PKI certificate, \"Mary J.<br>Smith\" in SEARCHLIGHT must be changed to \"Mary Jane Smith.\" In addition, for those people<br>who did not already have a PKI certificate by March 2003, it is important to know that the name<br>change has already occurred in SEARCHLIGHT. For those who already had a PKI certificate at<br>that time, the name change has been delayed until it is time to renew the PKI certificate. When<br>those people renew their PKI certificate, a process will be triggered to automatically change their<br>SEARCHLIGHT name to match their SECURITY CONCERTO name. If there are any differences<br>between the way names are stored in SEARCHLIGHT and HR CONCERTO, those differences will<br>have to be resolved by contacting Security Information, Q235 with an email to \"ISMT\" (as noted<br>above).<br>(U//FOUO) NAME DIFFERENCES IN PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CERTIFICATES:<br>(U//FOUO) Many of you who have previously received your PKI certificates, did so with your<br>name in SEARCHLIGHT at a time, and in a format, which preceded the \"rollover\" of names from<br>SECURITY CONCERTO.

The newly<br>appointed leadership team then took advantage of the opportunity to further their team<br>cohesiveness by performing a thorough analysis of SID's mission through a collective look at<br>SID's roles and responsibilities.<br>(U//FOUO) An atmosphere of close collaboration and honest communication was evident<br>throughout the 2-day session as the process of reviewing SID's mission authorities led to frank<br>discussions of pressing SID issues. Two vital concerns repeatedly expressed were the need for<br>teamwork to resonate throughout the organization, and the importance of aligning ourselves as<br>corporate citizens. In other words, good, productive working relationships are necessary at all<br>levels within SID, with our Extended Enterprise, and with our corporate enablers.<br>(U) A continuing theme with this leadership team is to decentralize decision-making.

The newlyappointed leadership team then took advantage of the opportunity to further their teamcohesiveness by performing a thorough analysis of SID's mission through a collective look atSID's roles and responsibilities.(U//FOUO) An atmosphere of close collaboration and honest communication was evidentthroughout the 2-day session as the process of reviewing SID's mission authorities led to frankdiscussions of pressing SID issues. Two vital concerns repeatedly expressed were the need forteamwork to resonate throughout the organization, and the importance of aligning ourselves ascorporate citizens. In other words, good, productive working relationships are necessary at alllevels within SID, with our Extended Enterprise, and with our corporate enablers.(U) A continuing theme with this leadership team is to decentralize decision-making. One of theirgoals is establishing a leadership style that \"...removes the obstacles and gets out of the way tolet the people do their work.\" One important decision made was not to reorganize-the focus ison honing the present organization into a more efficient contributor to America's security.(U//FOUO) While there were no specific deliverables from this meeting, additional SIDLeadership sessions will be scheduled in the near future to continue the momentum begun inthe first two off-sites.

Coming to NCEUR has allowed<br>me to re-enter, at least in part, the SIGINT world.

Stuttgart is in a great location since we<br>can travel to most of Germany, as well as France, Switzerland, or<br>Austria in a matter of a few hours. The rest of Europe is easily and<br>inexpensively accessed as well.

Most of your<br>personnel information is in what we'll call the \"HR\" part of CONCERTO. This is what you, your<br>supervisor, and other authorized people see when you log into CONCERTO and look at your<br>profile. Stuff like your awards, past assignments, etc. is in there. Obviously your name and your<br>SSN are part of HR CONCERTO for identification purposes. There is also a SECURITY part of<br>CONCERTO. This is where your clearances, etc. are kept. Your name and SSN are also part of<br>SECURITY CONCERTO for identification purposes. The two parts of CONCERTO are kept separate<br>for obvious security reasons, but \"Mary Jane Smith\" with SSN: 123-456-7890 in HR CONCERTO<br>is the same person as \"Smith,Mary Jane\" with SSN: 123-456-7890 in SECURITY CONCERTO.<br>(U//FOUO) SEARCHLIGHT is the Agency's corporate directory service. The \"registration\" of your<br>name and SSN in SEARCHLIGHT (for those of you whose SEARCHLIGHT records are marked<br>\"confirmed\") originated in the HR CONCERTO. In HR CONCERTO, middle initials tend to be more<br>prevalent than middle names. So \"Mary Jane Smith\" may have appeared in SEARCHLIGHT as<br>\"Mary J. Smith\".<br>(U//FOUO) ...ENTER THE PKI CERTIFICATE:<br>(U//FOUO) A required part of creating the PKI certificate, which is used to electronically identify<br>you, is the inclusion of your full name. Because your PKI will be used for identification in<br>electronic systems and exchanges (such as e-mail), the corporate directory system,<br>SEARCHLIGHT, must now have you registered with your full name. Part of your PKI certificate<br>also includes your security credentials and the official source of this information is SECURITY<br>CONCERTO. To get your PKI certificate, your full name must be in SEARCHLIGHT and must<br>match your full name in SECURITY CONCERTO. So, in order to get a PKI certificate, \"Mary J.<br>Smith\" in SEARCHLIGHT must be changed to \"Mary Jane Smith.\" In addition, for those people<br>who did not already have a PKI certificate by March 2003, it is important to know that the name<br>change has already occurred in SEARCHLIGHT. For those who already had a PKI certificate at<br>that time, the name change has been delayed until it is time to renew the PKI certificate. When<br>those people renew their PKI certificate, a process will be triggered to automatically change their<br>SEARCHLIGHT name to match their SECURITY CONCERTO name. If there are any differences<br>between the way names are stored in SEARCHLIGHT and HR CONCERTO, those differences will<br>have to be resolved by contacting Security Information, Q235 with an email to \"ISMT\" (as noted<br>above).<br>(U//FOUO) NAME DIFFERENCES IN PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CERTIFICATES:<br>(U//FOUO) Many of you who have previously received your PKI certificates, did so with your<br>name in SEARCHLIGHT at a time, and in a format, which preceded the \"rollover\" of names from<br>SECURITY CONCERTO. If they were different, that immediately created a mismatch between the<br>PKI and SEARCHLIGHT names, which equated to an identity failure and a subsequent PKI<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=\".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0\" class=\"SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph\">certificate revocation. However, prior discussions recognized this problem and the subsequent<br>impracticality of multiple revocations throughout the agency. It was consequently decided that<br>existing, valid PKI certificates which would encounter this condition would not be revoked, but<br>rather allowed to continue existing until their normal expiration date. The requirement for full<br>identity validation would then occur at renewal time, ultimately bringing everything in line and<br>eliminating the need for numerous immediate reapplications in the meantime.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information, see an announcement in What's New in SEARCHLIGHT .<br>Contributors to article: <br>, CRD Communications <br>, Concerto Representative <br>, Searchlight Representative <br><br>\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>",

As the Civil War raged, loved ones were cleaning Confederate soldiers' graves<br>in Columbus, Mississippi, placing flowers on them. They noticed nearby the Union soldiers<br>graves, dusty, overgrown with weeds. Grieving for their own fallen soldiers, the Confederate<br>women understood that the dead Union soldiers buried nearby were the cherished loved ones of<br>families and communities far away. They cleared the tangled brush and mud from those graves<br>as well as their own soldiers' graves and laid flowers on them all.<br>(U) Soon the tradition of a \"Decoration Day\" for the graves of fallen soldiers spread. On May 5,<br>1866, when the Civil War was over, Henry Welles of Waterloo, New York, closed his drugstore<br>and suggested that all other shops in town also close up for a day to honor all soldiers killed in<br>the Civil War, Union and Confederate alike. It was a gesture of healing and reconciliation in a<br>land ripped apart by conflict.<br>(U) Sixteen years later, in 1882, the nation observed its first official Memorial Day. Memorial Day<br>represents one day of national awareness and reverence, honoring those Americans who died<br>while defending our nation and its values. Since its beginnings, our country has faced many<br>threats that have tested its courage. From war-torn battlefields, conflicts at sea and air, to our<br>current global war against terrorism, generations of brave men and women have fought and died<br>to protect our democracy. Their sacrifices have made this nation strong and our world a better<br>place. While it's right that we should honor these heroes every day for the contribution they<br>have made to secure our nation's freedom, it's especially fitting that we remember them on<br>Memorial Day.<br>(U) When thinking about the true meaning of Memorial Day, the words of Charles M. Province<br>come to mind:<br>It is the Soldier, not the reporter, <br>Who has given us Freedom of the Press.<br>It is the Soldier, not the poet, <br>Who has given us Freedom of Speech.<br>It is the Soldier, not the campus organizer, <br>Who has given us the Freedom to demonstrate.<br>It is the Soldier, not the lawyer, <br>Who has given us the right to a fair trail.<br>And it is the Soldier--who salutes the flag, <br>Who serves the flag, and<br>Whose coffin is draped by the flag-- <br>Who allows the protester to burn the flag.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=\".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0\" class=\"SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph\">(U) So what are your plans for Memorial Day?

Something as simple as<br>observing the National Moment of Remembrance at 15:00 local time...a chance for all Americans<br>to pay tribute to those who placed country before self and paid the ultimate sacrifice for our<br>freedom.

From war-torn battlefields, conflicts at sea and air, to ourcurrent global war against terrorism, generations of brave men and women have fought and diedto protect our democracy. Their sacrifices have made this nation strong and our world a betterplace. While it's right that we should honor these heroes every day for the contribution theyhave made to secure our nation's freedom, it's especially fitting that we remember them onMemorial Day.(U) When thinking about the true meaning of Memorial Day, the words of Charles M. Provincecome to mind:It is the Soldier, not the reporter, Who has given us Freedom of the Press.It is the Soldier, not the poet, Who has given us Freedom of Speech.It is the Soldier, not the campus organizer, Who has given us the Freedom to demonstrate.It is the Soldier, not the lawyer, Who has given us the right to a fair trail.And it is the Soldier--who salutes the flag, Who serves the flag, andWhose coffin is draped by the flag-- Who allows the protester to burn the flag. (U) So what are your plans for Memorial Day? By all means enjoy your picnics and backyardbarbeque, the parades and baseball games or time with family and friends. But please alsoremember to take time to reflect on the true meaning of Memorial Day. Something as simple asobserving the National Moment of Remembrance at 15:00 local time...a chance for all Americansto pay tribute to those who placed country before self and paid the ultimate sacrifice for ourfreedom. We owe them a debt of honor and gratitude.\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

Their aimwas to promote an interest in international events and affairs whileproviding unique insights into those issues. That mission continuestoday, as the IAI routinely hosts speakers from classified andunclassified arenas to lecture on hot topics in international affairsand encourages its members to write and publish papers on relatedsubjects.(U//FOUO) The IAI employs many methods of raising awareness ofinternational affairs. These include annual events such as theInternational Challenge, which tests members and non-memberson their international affairs trivia, a book sale featuring the latestand greatest in international affairs literature, and an essay contestcovering a range of subjects. All of these endeavors are wellreceived by employees and many also include cash prizes for thewinners! SERIES: (U) NSA's LearnedOrganizations1.  A Look at NSA'sLearnedOrganizations2.

The busiest<br>months are typically March, April and May, because the staffers are<br>reviewing the CBJB and preparing their budget mark ups. This<br>year, a total of 18, 40, and 23 RFIs were received during these<br>months, respectively. A large majority of the queries require a very<br>quick turnaround during this time, and as it is LA's opportunity to<br>influence the mark ups, these requests are given focused<br>attention.<br>(U//FOUO) Requests for briefings tend to be heaviest from Jan May. Again, this is due to the fact that staffers are preparing for<br>their mark ups. This year, the number of staffer visits to SID<br>ranged from 12 to 16 per month during the period of March<br>through May. These visits often included multiple briefings.<br>(U) How Else Does SID LA Communicate With Congress?<br>(U//FOUO) In addition to budgeting issues, Congress is also<br>responsible for general oversight of NSA (and SID), to ensure we<br>are doing our job competently and adhering to the law. As a result,<br>we keep the Congress informed of significant developments that<br>may affect our performance (positively or negatively). A vehicle for<br>doing this is a \"Congressional Notification\". These range from \"bad<br>news\" reports-- such as power outages that have resulted in<br>degradation of service or security breaches at field stations-- to<br>items of interest such as:<br>the NSA Off-site Language Processing Facility;<br>Global Network Analyst Intern Program;<br>change in SID leadership; and<br>new partnerships with Third Parties.<br>As such, notifications are a great way to keep Congress informed of<br>good news as well as bad news. They should hear it from us before<br>they read it in the paper.<br>(U) How Does SID LA Communicate with the SID Workforce?<br>(U) Every Friday SID LA publishes a Weekly Congressional Update<br>providing feedback on recent congressional visits, highlighting<br>upcoming visits and congressional travel. This update can be found<br>on the SID LA website . The updates are also available via the SID<br>Notes/Reports section of the SID Today homepage.<br>(U) Organizational Structure<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID and Congress<br>1.

The office is not<br>forward-deployed from NSA LAO, but is actually assigned to SID<br>and staffed by SIGINTers.

The busiestmonths are typically March, April and May, because the staffers arereviewing the CBJB and preparing their budget mark ups. Thisyear, a total of 18, 40, and 23 RFIs were received during thesemonths, respectively. A large majority of the queries require a veryquick turnaround during this time, and as it is LA's opportunity toinfluence the mark ups, these requests are given focusedattention.(U//FOUO) Requests for briefings tend to be heaviest from Jan May. Again, this is due to the fact that staffers are preparing fortheir mark ups. This year, the number of staffer visits to SIDranged from 12 to 16 per month during the period of Marchthrough May. These visits often included multiple briefings.(U) How Else Does SID LA Communicate With Congress?(U//FOUO) In addition to budgeting issues, Congress is alsoresponsible for general oversight of NSA (and SID), to ensure weare doing our job competently and adhering to the law. As a result,we keep the Congress informed of significant developments thatmay affect our performance (positively or negatively). A vehicle fordoing this is a \"Congressional Notification\". These range from \"badnews\" reports-- such as power outages that have resulted indegradation of service or security breaches at field stations-- toitems of interest such as:the NSA Off-site Language Processing Facility;Global Network Analyst Intern Program;change in SID leadership; andnew partnerships with Third Parties.As such, notifications are a great way to keep Congress informed ofgood news as well as bad news. They should hear it from us beforethey read it in the paper.(U) How Does SID LA Communicate with the SID Workforce?(U) Every Friday SID LA publishes a Weekly Congressional Updateproviding feedback on recent congressional visits, highlightingupcoming visits and congressional travel. This update can be foundon the SID LA website . The updates are also available via the SIDNotes/Reports section of the SID Today homepage.(U) Organizational Structure SERIES: (U) SID and Congress1.  SID's Interactionswith Congress:Setting the Budget2.  SID's Interactionswith Congress:Budget Jargon andRFIs3.  SID's Interactionswith Congress:Communications andOrgs4.  Re-Invigorating theCollectionAssociation (U) How Does SID LA Work With NSA's LAO?(U//FOUO) SID LA provides congressional staffers and committeeswith appropriate SIGINT-related information and briefings anddevelop the SID Congressional Engagement Strategy for inclusioninto the overall NSA Engagement Strategy. The office is notforward-deployed from NSA LAO, but is actually assigned to SIDand staffed by SIGINTers. It is structured similarly to NSA LAO inthat SID LA has separate \"account managers\" for the involvedcongressional committees. Office personnel usually attend SIDbriefings to the congressional staffs and committees and providefeedback on these sessions to SID leadership. They can thenprovide background information as to the tone and contextsurrounding follow-on queries from Congress.(U//FOUO) For further information on how NSA LAO interacts withCongress, see their web page at \"go lao\".\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

After a hustled day of tackling a<br>myriad of issues and directly contributing to the global war on<br>terrorism, one might be inclined to drive out to Phillips Park and<br>enjoy a gorgeous sunset over Leeward Landing; however, the day<br>would not be complete without the frequent iguana encounter. Few<br>work environments offer such an opportunity - a rewarding<br>challenge with incredible surroundings.<br>(S//REL) The mission of JTF-GTMO is to conduct detention and<br>interrogation operations to collect and exploit intelligence in<br>support of the global war on terrorism (GWOT), to screen<br>detainees, and to support law enforcement and war crimes<br>investigations. The NSA Liaison Officer (NSA LNO) works in the<br>Joint Interrogation Group (JIG), a major element of JTF-GTMO. The<br>interrogation focus at Guantanamo is strategic; tactical questioning<br>is accomplished in-theater to see what they know, categorize them<br>accordingly, and determine what requirements they can satisfy.<br>(S) The work can be extremely interesting, challenging and very<br>fulfilling. On a given week, the NSA LNO might pull together<br>intelligence to support an upcoming interrogation, formulate<br>questions and strategies for the interrogation, and observe or<br>participate in the interrogation. Afterward, the LNO captures and<br>disseminates pertinent technical information gleaned from the<br>interrogation back to NSA TOPIs for SIGINT development.<br>(U//FOUO) Outside work, fun awaits and opportunities abound.<br>Water sports are outstanding: boating, paddling, fishing, water<br>skiing and boarding, sailing, swimming, snorkeling, and SCUBA. No<br>experience, no problem. Learn how to operate a boat in a weekend,<br>become a certified open water scuba diver within weeks. If you've<br>already mastered these skills, or once you do, the MWR marina<br>rents boats from pontoon party boats to Carolina skiffs to ski boats<br>to kayaks...and recently they've added sailboat rentals, too. The<br>local dive shop has all the gear and tips to ensure a perfect outing.<br>Surround all this water fun with a Tiki Bar and a Jerk House as well<br>as the Bayview Restaurant ... relaxing is easy.<br>(U//FOUO) Water sports not your cup of tea? There are many<br>other activities to round your day off. The library has two dozen<br>internet terminals and over 1000 videos. Or take in a movie at the<br>outdoor theatre featuring a weekly variety of the latest releases.<br>Other activities include: pottery, hiking, nature walks, biking,<br>paintball, martial arts, tennis, racquetball, basketball, softball, and<br>bowling.

After a hustled day of tackling amyriad of issues and directly contributing to the global war onterrorism, one might be inclined to drive out to Phillips Park andenjoy a gorgeous sunset over Leeward Landing; however, the daywould not be complete without the frequent iguana encounter. Fewwork environments offer such an opportunity - a rewardingchallenge with incredible surroundings.(S//REL) The mission of JTF-GTMO is to conduct detention andinterrogation operations to collect and exploit intelligence insupport of the global war on terrorism (GWOT), to screendetainees, and to support law enforcement and war crimesinvestigations. The NSA Liaison Officer (NSA LNO) works in theJoint Interrogation Group (JIG), a major element of JTF-GTMO. Theinterrogation focus at Guantanamo is strategic; tactical questioningis accomplished in-theater to see what they know, categorize themaccordingly, and determine what requirements they can satisfy.(S) The work can be extremely interesting, challenging and veryfulfilling. On a given week, the NSA LNO might pull togetherintelligence to support an upcoming interrogation, formulatequestions and strategies for the interrogation, and observe orparticipate in the interrogation. Afterward, the LNO captures anddisseminates pertinent technical information gleaned from theinterrogation back to NSA TOPIs for SIGINT development.(U//FOUO) Outside work, fun awaits and opportunities abound.Water sports are outstanding: boating, paddling, fishing, waterskiing and boarding, sailing, swimming, snorkeling, and SCUBA. Noexperience, no problem. Learn how to operate a boat in a weekend,become a certified open water scuba diver within weeks. If you'vealready mastered these skills, or once you do, the MWR marinarents boats from pontoon party boats to Carolina skiffs to ski boatsto kayaks...and recently they've added sailboat rentals, too. Thelocal dive shop has all the gear and tips to ensure a perfect outing.Surround all this water fun with a Tiki Bar and a Jerk House as wellas the Bayview Restaurant ... relaxing is easy.(U//FOUO) Water sports not your cup of tea? There are manyother activities to round your day off. The library has two dozeninternet terminals and over 1000 videos. Or take in a movie at theoutdoor theatre featuring a weekly variety of the latest releases.Other activities include: pottery, hiking, nature walks, biking,paintball, martial arts, tennis, racquetball, basketball, softball, andbowling.

Advance registration is required; click HERE for<br>instructions.<br>Course Overview:<br>(C) The fallout from the Iraqi campaign has been largely negative for Turkey, and the full impact<br>of this very bitter episode in U.S.- Turkish relations is still unknown. The pro-Islam Justice and<br>Development Party (AKP) and the Turkish General Staff (TGS), guardian of Turkey's secular<br>democracy, view each other with mutual suspicion. The strategic relationship with the U.S. is<br>seriously weakened, so the U.S. is unlikely to champion Turkey's cause in Europe or with the<br>IMF/World Bank as fervently.

Advance registration is required; click HERE forinstructions.Course Overview:(C) The fallout from the Iraqi campaign has been largely negative for Turkey, and the full impactof this very bitter episode in U.S.- Turkish relations is still unknown. The pro-Islam Justice andDevelopment Party (AKP) and the Turkish General Staff (TGS), guardian of Turkey's seculardemocracy, view each other with mutual suspicion. The strategic relationship with the U.S. isseriously weakened, so the U.S. is unlikely to champion Turkey's cause in Europe or with theIMF/World Bank as fervently. In addition, Turkey's regional influence, particularly in northernIraq, has been significantly diminished.

Then, less than a month later, the first E-series product report (extremely<br>sensitive serialized reports sent to a limited audience) was issued by International Security<br>Issues, (S2C21). Many other offices now use this collection, as well - the FAIRVIEW DNI access<br>is extremely high-volume and delivers a very broad target set covering all SIGINT product lines.<br>For example, the initial deployment of the FAIRVIEW DNI access, for e-mail only, is now<br>forwarding more than one million emails a day to the keyword selection system at NSAW.<br>(TS//SI) STORMBREW has a complementary large-scale DNI collection effort (covername<br>PERFECTSTORM) that is just about ready for prime time. As the large-scale effort was being<br>developed, STORMBREW deployed several QRC (Quick Reaction Capability) collection systems<br>that have yielded critical intelligence supporting the Global War on Terrorism. STORMBREW<br>engineers then worked with FAIRVIEW engineers to transfer this collection architecture to<br>FAIRVIEW. Recently, FAIRVIEW identified the \"other side\" of one of the STORMBREW QRC links,<br>and was able to use the same collection architecture to rapidly put this new link on cover. This<br>type of complementary access provides the A&amp;P; analysts with more complete coverage of their<br>target. In addition, STORMBREW and FAIRVIEW personnel worked side-by-side with CES<br>personnel to add Voice over IP processing capabilities to both of these accesses to further<br>exploit the targets' communications.<br>(TS//SI) In addition to email, FAIRVIEW and STORMBREW are also collecting metadata, or data<br>about the network and the communications it carries. For September 2003 alone, FAIRVIEW<br>captured several trillion metadata records - of which more than 400 billion were selected for<br>downstream processing or storage.

Then, less than a month later, the first E-series product report (extremelysensitive serialized reports sent to a limited audience) was issued by International SecurityIssues, (S2C21). Many other offices now use this collection, as well - the FAIRVIEW DNI accessis extremely high-volume and delivers a very broad target set covering all SIGINT product lines.For example, the initial deployment of the FAIRVIEW DNI access, for e-mail only, is nowforwarding more than one million emails a day to the keyword selection system at NSAW.(TS//SI) STORMBREW has a complementary large-scale DNI collection effort (covernamePERFECTSTORM) that is just about ready for prime time. As the large-scale effort was beingdeveloped, STORMBREW deployed several QRC (Quick Reaction Capability) collection systemsthat have yielded critical intelligence supporting the Global War on Terrorism. STORMBREWengineers then worked with FAIRVIEW engineers to transfer this collection architecture toFAIRVIEW. Recently, FAIRVIEW identified the \"other side\" of one of the STORMBREW QRC links,and was able to use the same collection architecture to rapidly put this new link on cover. Thistype of complementary access provides the A&amp;P; analysts with more complete coverage of theirtarget. In addition, STORMBREW and FAIRVIEW personnel worked side-by-side with CESpersonnel to add Voice over IP processing capabilities to both of these accesses to furtherexploit the targets' communications.(TS//SI) In addition to email, FAIRVIEW and STORMBREW are also collecting metadata, or dataabout the network and the communications it carries. For September 2003 alone, FAIRVIEWcaptured several trillion metadata records - of which more than 400 billion were selected fordownstream processing or storage. This metadata will be used to enable the surgical collectionof much smaller amounts of target-rich data - which should extend beyond FAIRVIEW andSTORMBREW to many other DNI accesses across NSA. This metadata is flowing to MAINWAY(contact chaining database) today, and a major interface to the Knowledge System Prototype(KSP) is only days away from its operational debut.

The clock is ticking and everyone is on an end-of-the-year deadline! But what are<br>these mysterious certificates? Who needs them? How do we get them? AND WHY?!?! The<br>following paragraphs will answer these questions and offer a few secrets on how to get certified<br>as quickly and as painlessly as possible! Don't wait until October--this requirement is not going<br>to go away, so get it out of your way now!!!<br>(U//FOUO) First, what is a PKI certificate? PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure. The PKI<br>system is a comprehensive encryption system that protects information against unauthorized<br>disclosure, unauthorized modifications through digital signing, unauthorized access by enabling<br>access controls and authorization services, and false user identifications.<br>(U//FOUO) Who needs them? Almost everyone! If you work at NSA and you are a US citizen<br>holding a blue, green, or gold badge, then YOU NEED ONE! So if you are a Second Party member<br>or a non-US citizen, then you have some breathing room, but the system will be ready for you<br>soon!<br>(U//FOUO) WHY do we need them? This is perhaps the most important question. The answer<br>is multi-fold. First, the current email encryption system, ICARUS, is going away. It will be out of<br>service and the PKI system is the replacement. In addition, the PKI certificate will soon be a<br>necessity in order to use CONCERTO, Peoplesoft, and other similar applications. So even if you<br>rarely send encrypted emails, you still need to get the certificate. Without it, your<br>individual access to certain information will be significantly limited.<br>(U//FOUO) Now you know what a PKI certificate is, who needs it, and why. So now you need to<br>know HOW TO GET IT! Here's how:<br>(U//FOUO) Take a deep breath. Accept that this will take a bit of your time, but it must be done,<br>so just dive in! Type \"go pki\" on the web. The PKI home page will appear and it will walk you<br>through a four-step process that will culminate in obtaining your certificate.<br>(U//FOUO) Warning! There are a few items in the process that can be confusing. Reading these<br>hints, in conjunction with the instructions on the home page, will guarantee some time saved:<br>1) Before you start, make sure that you have an active Searchlight account. If you do<br>not, you will need to get one before you can get the certificate.<br>2) When you get to the PKI Home Page, there are two seemingly good options: \"Getting<br>your NTS-PKI Personal Certificate\" and \"Getting your NTS-PKI Server Certificate\". Click<br>on \"Getting your NTS-PKI Personal Certificate\".<br>3) If you are a Second Party member, you cannot get a PKI Certificate yet.<br>4) In Step 2, the directions instruct you to check for your secondary SMTP address.<br>Your secondary SMTP address is the lowercase one. You will see SMTP and smtp; the<br>address that follows the smtp is your secondary address .<br>5) If you do not have either the security switch or the secondary SMTP address.

Just send <br>@nsa a<br>short email that says your information does not match, and they will immediately fix it.<br>(Note: I had to call to get my secondary SMTP address and I had to send an email about<br>a Searchlight mismatch, and getting to STEP 4 still only took me about 15 minutes! It<br>just sounds worse than it is!)<br>8) Thursday morning is not a good time for getting your PKI. The server goes through<br>maintenance then, and the kiosks open late. It is possible to get your certificate in the<br>late morning on Thursdays, but another day is probably a better option, if possible.<br>9) Going to the kiosks. Ok, this involves a little bit of physical energy. Yes, you have to<br>leave your desk and go to the kiosk (room) closest to you. If (and only if) you have to<br>travel outside of the building, you must bring a courier bag with you. Please<br>expect the kiosk to take about 15 minutes. It takes a few minutes for the machine to<br>generate a password and to print it out. So don't get agitated, just expect a short wait.<br>10) VERY IMPORTANT!

Gregory Wessel, Technical Director for SIGINT Development<br>, was nice enough to oblige:<br>(U) Question: What do you consider the role of a DISL to be? How does it differ from that of a<br>GS employee or a DISES?<br>(U//FOUO) The DISL over the last years has taken on two roles; one of a Technical Leader and<br>one of a Technical Expert.<br>(U//FOUO) A DISL Technical Leader works at the office or group level formulating strategic<br>vision, making architectural and framework recommendations, ensuring technology<br>transformation and workforce technical health, steering technical requirements in development<br>efforts, and looking out for the health and well-being of the mission. They also create<br>mechanisms to interact with the workforce, enablers, and outside technical boards to ensure<br>that the best technical advice is obtained on any issues. They serve as a sounding board and<br>sanity check for new technical ideas and recommendations from the workforce and assist the<br>DISES in running the corporation.<br>(U//FOUO) The DISL Technical Expert is a recognized expert in his/her field, possessing both the<br>breadth and depth of expertise in the skill sets related to his/her areas of specialization acquired<br>via formally documented and peer-acknowledged academic qualifications and mission work. Of<br>considerable importance are personal and team accomplishments, achievements in their field of<br>expertise, continuous learning to stay on the cutting edge. One of the major functions a DISL<br>should perform in the mentoring of junior and senior analysts throughout the agency.<br>(U//FOUO) The DISL differs from a DISES in a number of ways. A DISES has a contract with<br>NSA to lead/manage people and change, build coalitions within the building and with<br>partners/customers, and develop and employ business acumen to acquire and administer<br>human, financial, material, and information resources to run the corporation. A DISL is<br>responsible for the technical leadership and expertise to aid the DISES in carrying out his/her<br>duties for NSA.<br>(U) Question: What is the best part of being a DISL? ...the hardest part?<br>(U) The best part of being a DISL is having the ability to influence the decision-making<br>processes, provide technical advice and guidance, and drive technology transformation at the<br>office and group level for the corporation.

    "plain_text": "DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL(U) Interview with a DISLFROM: SIGINT CommunicationsUnknownRun Date: 12/23/2003(U//FOUO) As part of our \"Senior Exec\" series, we decided to ask a DISL to answer somequestions related to his job. Gregory Wessel, Technical Director for SIGINT Development, was nice enough to oblige:(U) Question: What do you consider the role of a DISL to be? How does it differ from that of aGS employee or a DISES?(U//FOUO) The DISL over the last years has taken on two roles; one of a Technical Leader andone of a Technical Expert.(U//FOUO) A DISL Technical Leader works at the office or group level formulating strategicvision, making architectural and framework recommendations, ensuring technologytransformation and workforce technical health, steering technical requirements in developmentefforts, and looking out for the health and well-being of the mission. They also createmechanisms to interact with the workforce, enablers, and outside technical boards to ensurethat the best technical advice is obtained on any issues. They serve as a sounding board andsanity check for new technical ideas and recommendations from the workforce and assist theDISES in running the corporation.(U//FOUO) The DISL Technical Expert is a recognized expert in his/her field, possessing both thebreadth and depth of expertise in the skill sets related to his/her areas of specialization acquiredvia formally documented and peer-acknowledged academic qualifications and mission work. Ofconsiderable importance are personal and team accomplishments, achievements in their field ofexpertise, continuous learning to stay on the cutting edge. One of the major functions a DISLshould perform in the mentoring of junior and senior analysts throughout the agency.(U//FOUO) The DISL differs from a DISES in a number of ways. A DISES has a contract withNSA to lead/manage people and change, build coalitions within the building and withpartners/customers, and develop and employ business acumen to acquire and administerhuman, financial, material, and information resources to run the corporation. A DISL isresponsible for the technical leadership and expertise to aid the DISES in carrying out his/herduties for NSA.(U) Question: What is the best part of being a DISL? ...the hardest part?(U) The best part of being a DISL is having the ability to influence the decision-makingprocesses, provide technical advice and guidance, and drive technology transformation at theoffice and group level for the corporation. In addition to those listed above, being able to providetechnical leadership and mentoring to other agency employees is exciting and rewarding.(U) For DISLs who are more technical experts in their fields, being recognized as that is verysatisfying in itself. But more important is making breakthroughs in areas that have remaineddifficult challenges for the Agency. Having a parking place is also a major perk for a DISL.(U) The hardest part of being a DISL is not having the governance authority to make decisions.This is still seen as one of the DISES roles for the corporation.(U) Question: What are the \"must have\" talents a person needs to succeed as a DISL?(U) Depending on the type of DISL (leader or expert), they need to have a broad range oftechnical talents or be very deeply entrenched in their area of expertise. The DISL needs to have the ability to provide technical guidance to help influence decision-making by the DISES andhave the talents to mentor and guide others careers. In addition, the DISL needs to have theattitude that their opinions and technical advice are valued by the corporation and should beheeded.(U) Question: What advice would you give to someone who would like to become a DISL?What training/experience should that person seek out?(U) Anyone wishing to become a DISL needs to either have broad technical leadership abilitieswith a proven track record of technical accomplishments or have deep technical expertise in adiscipline and be a recognized go-to person by other agency employees and seniors. Those whobecome DISLs are often ones that don't shy away from the hardest problems facing the agencyand instead make significant contributions.(U//FOUO) The only formal training program for DISLs is the Senior Technical DevelopmentProgram (STDP). The STDP is a career development program structured to build NSA'stechnical/professional leaders for the next decade. In addition to the formal program, a DISLwant-to-be can take leadership training through the NCS and also technical academic training toenhance their technical skills and expertise.(U//FOUO) We hope to interview a DISES next... stay tuned!\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

First, an analyst may ask KSP<br>to find all organizations in several named countries that have the word \"trading\" in them. Once<br>this information is displayed, the analyst may then have those organizations' known email<br>addresses and phone numbers added to the display. From this, certain trends may appear. For<br>example, perhaps two of the organizations are companies that share a common phone number an indication that the same company may go by multiple names.

So, in this example, it would find<br>all other cases where companies with different names use the same phone number or email<br>address. Since KSP is \"anticipating\" questions, it can have the answers already prepared and<br>ready to go for the next time an analyst asks that question.

Of particular significance is the fact that GIS hasenabled the first multi-agency reporting in NSA history, as SIGINT and imagery are fused tocreate joint NSA / NGA (formerly NIMA) reports.(U) Presentations are available at the GIS Day topics website (or \"go gis day\").(U) We are anxious to hear what you thought about GIS Day.

Intelligence analysis is not done by rote. Our tradecraft is, necessarily, dynamic andcomprehensive. It is incumbent upon an analyst to keep up with new techniques, to be aware ofbest practices, and to develop best practices by sharing their own valuable experiences withothers in the community. The Analysis Conference is meant to provide these opportunities.(U//FOUO) This year's conference featured more than 80 presentations. Keynote speakersincluded (in order of appearance):Dr. Mark Lowenthal, A/DCI for Analysis &amp; Production;Dr. John Poindexter, Director Information Awareness Office;Lt Gen Michael Hayden, Director NSA;Lt Gen (Ret.) James Clapper, Director NIMA;MG Richard Quirk, SID Director;Ms. Maureen Baginski, FBI Exec Director for Intelligence; A/DDAP;Dr. William Nolte, Deputy A/DCI for Analysis &amp; Production; and,Mr. Jim Allen, DDAP.Major points that emerged from the talks included: active analysis, building a strong analyticcommunity, and raising the quality vice the quantity of our reporting.(U//FOUO) More than 700 people participated in the conference, including a number ofrepresentatives from CSE, GCHQ, DSD, GCSB, CIA, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, andour field sites. We ask that those who attended this year's conference help us to make NEXTyear's conference even better by filling out a feedback form , which is also available via \"goanalysis conference\".(U//FOUO) Speaking of next year's conference, we are already making plans, with a target dateof late spring or early summer. Please plan to attend, perhaps present a topic, or recommend aguest speaker. The web page for next year's conference will probably be posted sometime nextMarch.(U//FOUO) Thank you for making this year's conference such a success.

This class is sponsored by the Director of<br>Central Intelligence (DCI) and is intended to bring together senior executives from across the<br>intelligence community to examine and discuss major issues affecting national security decision<br>making, intelligence strategies, interoperability, and intelligence support to the nation. Our class<br>also included for the first time a member of the Secret Service as a consumer of intelligence and<br>the class had the very good fortune to be mentored by <br>, a retired NSA senior<br>executive with significant CIA experience.<br>(U//FOUO) The tone of the class was set on the first full day of presentations with a discussion<br>led by the Honorable George J. Tenet, DCI. Mr. Tenet discussed the major issues facing the<br>intelligence community, his vision of the future, and his challenges to our class as a group of<br>leaders responsible for leading the intelligence community. In contrast to the abundant chatter<br>we have all heard over the past two years about an intelligence community reorganization, Mr.<br>Tenet instead emphasized the imperative of \"horizontal integration\" across the intelligence<br>community as the key to success. Other major themes that emerged included succession<br>planning; recruitment, training, and retention; compensation reform; and Agency responsibilities<br>to provide support to families of intelligence community personnel, especially those in extended<br>and dangerous field positions.<br>(U//FOUO) A great number of the presentations and discussions in the three weeks that followed<br>focused on these themes. Each ICSLP class travels for a week-long TDY to different intelligence<br>community-related places. Our class went to San Antonio to visit the Air Intelligence Agency<br>(AIA), the Medina Regional Security Operations Center (MRSOC), and the University of Texas at<br>San Antonio (UTSA). This was my first visit to an RSOC and it was a major eye-opener to the<br>entire class to see the type and quality of work being done by a largely very young workforce,<br>and their remarkable dedication in the performance of duties. It was also obvious where we<br>need to work harder to cement partnerships with the MRSOC. The UTSA visit drove home the<br>importance of partnerships between the intelligence and academic communities. Seeing the<br>work of groups of high school interns, university students and faculty working on information<br>assurance, steganography and many other issues in a school that prides itself in a very effective<br>cultural diversity program left us all in awe of what can be accomplished when one knows no<br>limits. The class also discovered that it is indeed possible to become tired of Mexican food while<br>maintaining a taste for Margaritas.<br>(U//FOUO) The discussion that tightly cemented the class together came in the last few days<br>when we heard from Mr. Jim Miklaszewski, the Pentagon correspondent for NBC News. An<br>articulate speaker, his discussion touched on the approach reporters take to gather, present,<br>and sometimes protect the information they report on. Class students quizzed him extensively<br>on the subject of leaks, obviously with consternation that any fellow community member would<br>provide privileged information to members of the press. One student drove home class feelings<br>on the subject by asking Mr. Miklaszewski how he differentiated reporter recruitment of US<br>intelligence sources from recruitment of foreign Humint sources when the US sources are<br>committing a felony by \"leaking information\" to reporters who are accessories after the fact.

Attendees represented CENTCOM, CENTCOM components, Special<br>Operations Forces, the Army Technical Control and Analysis Element (ATCAE), the Service<br>Cryptologic Elements, GCHQ, Integrated Broadcast Special Support Office (IBSSO), CIA, DIA,<br>Menwith Hill Station, Denver Mission Ground Station, Gordon RSOC, and many organizations<br>here at NSAW. Total attendance for the three days was over 270 personnel.<br>(S) The purpose of the conference, captured in <br> (SIGINT collection manager<br>at CENTCOM's Joint Intelligence Center) opening remarks was to highlight SIGINT operations<br>through the eyes of many national-tactical players across the \"extended enterprise\" and assess<br>and document what NSA did well - as well as identify areas where things could have been done<br>better. <br>was followed by <br>from NSA's Office of Information Management<br>who welcomed CENTCOM and the other participants and highlighted two major themes from<br>the Tiger Team Review of the NSA-submitted lessons learned:<br>the value of collaboration during the campaign and<br>the many new initiatives developed to support the war efforts.<br>(S) The format of the conference was a series of briefings by participants at all levels<br>highlighting the various roles SIGINT played in both campaigns, focusing discussion on what<br>was done right and what still needed attention.

Attendees represented CENTCOM, CENTCOM components, SpecialOperations Forces, the Army Technical Control and Analysis Element (ATCAE), the ServiceCryptologic Elements, GCHQ, Integrated Broadcast Special Support Office (IBSSO), CIA, DIA,Menwith Hill Station, Denver Mission Ground Station, Gordon RSOC, and many organizationshere at NSAW. Total attendance for the three days was over 270 personnel.(S) The purpose of the conference, captured in  (SIGINT collection managerat CENTCOM's Joint Intelligence Center) opening remarks was to highlight SIGINT operationsthrough the eyes of many national-tactical players across the \"extended enterprise\" and assessand document what NSA did well - as well as identify areas where things could have been donebetter. was followed by from NSA's Office of Information Managementwho welcomed CENTCOM and the other participants and highlighted two major themes fromthe Tiger Team Review of the NSA-submitted lessons learned:the value of collaboration during the campaign andthe many new initiatives developed to support the war efforts.(S) The format of the conference was a series of briefings by participants at all levelshighlighting the various roles SIGINT played in both campaigns, focusing discussion on whatwas done right and what still needed attention. It was obvious by the lively discussion anddebate that there was a great deal of passion for the topics that surfaced. In terms of overallsuccess themes in SIGINT support for the warfighter , the conference identified the valueof:the GEO Cell,continuous interaction using tools such as ZIRCON (mentioned several times as beingcritical to success),making the warfighter smarter about what NSA can and cannot do, andthe warfighter making NSA smarter about their operations and key information needs,SIGINT herding,the federated SIGINT operations (national-tactical integration and embedding analystsforward for the critical expertise in military operations to know where and when to applySIGINT),advance planning for Overhead assets,Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) packages,the CENTCOM Theater Coordination Collection Architecture,the value of GRSOC as a model for RSOC warfighter support operations, andwhat was characterized as the \"best (SIGINT) planning to date.\"(S) Among the issues mentioned in the \"needs improvement\" category were:database access by tactical assets,relevant SIGINT product in a coalition environment (NOFORN, tearline, and SIPRNetissues),exploitation of HF,advanced training,modernization of the threat warning architecture using web-based capabilities,National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) and the RFI management process,the tardy introduction of Info Work Space, and the need for national connection to SIGINT airborne assets.(U//FOUO) Mr. Charles Berlin, SID Chief of Staff thanked all attendees for the outstandingdiscussion and pledged that NSA would continue working to improve warfighter support.\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

When I left Vietnam for the last time in June 1968, there<br>were 530,000 personnel and we were well on the way to the final tally of over 50,000 Americans<br>killed and many more maimed for life. I survived combat without a scratch, including being<br>knocked on my butt during the TET offensive by a 122mm rocket and a horrible and<br>unforgettable battle for some numbered mountain top during the battle for Dak To in November<br>1967. I looked men in their alive eyes in the morning, and their dead eyes by the end of the<br>day.

I encourage anyone interested in seeing a \"view from the top\" to<br>consider signing up for the program. You won't regret it! But first a word of caution, make sure<br>you get a good night sleep the night before, you're in for a very full day!<br>(U//FOUO) The schedule that Mr. Meals keeps is quite grueling. Briefings, meetings, and<br>courtesy calls begin at 0730, don't end until 1800, and cover myriad topics. During my<br>experience, I gained new insights into a project I was already familiar with during one briefing,<br>was briefed on two prototype systems during another, learned about efforts to improve the<br>early/threat warning process at a field site, and even developed some appreciation of metrics<br>during a Corporate Metrics Review meeting.<br>(U//FOUO) But what impressed me most was how cohesively Major General Quirk, Charlie<br>Meals, and their staff work as a team. As an analyst, I came away with the feeling that, although<br>they're physically removed from the analytic shops, they have the rank and file civilian and<br>military workers in the forefront of their minds when they raise questions during a presentation<br>or make a decision. I now feel that they are more like coworkers, part of my \"team\". Their focus<br>is on enhancing and unencumbering the workplace as much as possible for the benefit of the<br>analysts, which leads to increased productivity and efficiency.<br>(U//FOUO) For example, during the corporate metrics meeting Mr. Meals mentioned the<br>prospect of an easy-to-use tool for analysts to seek and add product requirements to each<br>report. Mr. Meals' concern was that the tool not be just another instrument which analysts<br>would be forced to learn how to use. Rather, it had to be easy/transparent to use, or have<br>similar features incorporated in tools already in use and familiar to analysts.<br>(U//FOUO) Likewise, during a briefing on the possibility of deployment of equipment from one<br>field site to another, MG Quirk was primarily concerned about the impact of the transfer on the<br>people at the sites. He questioned if the transfer would be just a \"band aid\" to temporarily fix<br>the problem, or if it would provide a more permanent solution.<br>(U//FOUO) Collaboration and cooperation are alive and well at the top of the Signals Intelligence<br>Directorate, but you don't have to take my word for it - sign up to be a shadow and see for<br>yourself!<br><br>\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>",

But first a word of caution, make sureyou get a good night sleep the night before, you're in for a very full day!(U//FOUO) The schedule that Mr. Meals keeps is quite grueling. Briefings, meetings, andcourtesy calls begin at 0730, don't end until 1800, and cover myriad topics. During myexperience, I gained new insights into a project I was already familiar with during one briefing,was briefed on two prototype systems during another, learned about efforts to improve theearly/threat warning process at a field site, and even developed some appreciation of metricsduring a Corporate Metrics Review meeting.(U//FOUO) But what impressed me most was how cohesively Major General Quirk, CharlieMeals, and their staff work as a team. As an analyst, I came away with the feeling that, althoughthey're physically removed from the analytic shops, they have the rank and file civilian andmilitary workers in the forefront of their minds when they raise questions during a presentationor make a decision. I now feel that they are more like coworkers, part of my \"team\". Their focusis on enhancing and unencumbering the workplace as much as possible for the benefit of theanalysts, which leads to increased productivity and efficiency.(U//FOUO) For example, during the corporate metrics meeting Mr. Meals mentioned theprospect of an easy-to-use tool for analysts to seek and add product requirements to eachreport. Mr. Meals' concern was that the tool not be just another instrument which analystswould be forced to learn how to use. Rather, it had to be easy/transparent to use, or havesimilar features incorporated in tools already in use and familiar to analysts.(U//FOUO) Likewise, during a briefing on the possibility of deployment of equipment from onefield site to another, MG Quirk was primarily concerned about the impact of the transfer on thepeople at the sites. He questioned if the transfer would be just a \"band aid\" to temporarily fixthe problem, or if it would provide a more permanent solution.(U//FOUO) Collaboration and cooperation are alive and well at the top of the Signals IntelligenceDirectorate, but you don't have to take my word for it - sign up to be a shadow and see foryourself!\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

Again, this is due to the<br>fact that staffers are preparing for their mark ups.

These visits often<br>included multiple briefings.<br>(U) How Else Does SID LA Communicate With Congress?<br>(U//FOUO) In addition to budgeting issues, Congress is also responsible for general oversight of<br>NSA (and SID), to ensure we are doing our job competently and adhering to the law. As a result,<br>we keep the Congress informed of significant developments that may affect our performance<br>(positively or negatively). A vehicle for doing this is a \"Congressional Notification\". These range<br>from \"bad news\" reports-- such as power outages that have resulted in degradation of service or<br>security breaches at field stations-- to items of interest such as:<br>the NSA Off-site Language Processing Facility;<br>Global Network Analyst Intern Program;<br>change in SID leadership; and<br>new partnerships with Third Parties.<br>As such, notifications are a great way to keep Congress informed of good news as well as bad<br>news. They should hear it from us before they read it in the paper.<br>(U) How Does SID LA Communicate with the SID Workforce?<br>(U) Every Friday SID LA publishes a Weekly Congressional Update providing feedback on recent<br>congressional visits, highlighting upcoming visits and congressional travel.

The updates are also available via the SID Notes/Reports<br>section of the SID Today homepage.<br>(U) Organizational Structure<br>(U) How Does SID LA Work With NSA's LAO?<br>(U//FOUO) SID LA provides congressional staffers and committees with appropriate SIGINTrelated information and briefings and develop the SID Congressional Engagement Strategy for<br>inclusion into the overall NSA Engagement Strategy. The office is not forward-deployed from<br>NSA LAO, but is actually assigned to SID and staffed by SIGINTers. It is structured similarly to<br>NSA LAO in that SID LA has separate \"account managers\" for the involved congressional<br>committees. Office personnel usually attend SID briefings to the congressional staffs and<br>committees and provide feedback on these sessions to SID leadership.

Again, this is due to thefact that staffers are preparing for their mark ups. This year, the number of staffer visits to SIDranged from 12 to 16 per month during the period of March through May. These visits oftenincluded multiple briefings.(U) How Else Does SID LA Communicate With Congress?(U//FOUO) In addition to budgeting issues, Congress is also responsible for general oversight ofNSA (and SID), to ensure we are doing our job competently and adhering to the law. As a result,we keep the Congress informed of significant developments that may affect our performance(positively or negatively). A vehicle for doing this is a \"Congressional Notification\". These rangefrom \"bad news\" reports-- such as power outages that have resulted in degradation of service orsecurity breaches at field stations-- to items of interest such as:the NSA Off-site Language Processing Facility;Global Network Analyst Intern Program;change in SID leadership; andnew partnerships with Third Parties.As such, notifications are a great way to keep Congress informed of good news as well as badnews. They should hear it from us before they read it in the paper.(U) How Does SID LA Communicate with the SID Workforce?(U) Every Friday SID LA publishes a Weekly Congressional Update providing feedback on recentcongressional visits, highlighting upcoming visits and congressional travel. This update can befound on the SID LA website . The updates are also available via the SID Notes/Reportssection of the SID Today homepage.(U) Organizational Structure(U) How Does SID LA Work With NSA's LAO?(U//FOUO) SID LA provides congressional staffers and committees with appropriate SIGINTrelated information and briefings and develop the SID Congressional Engagement Strategy forinclusion into the overall NSA Engagement Strategy. The office is not forward-deployed fromNSA LAO, but is actually assigned to SID and staffed by SIGINTers. It is structured similarly toNSA LAO in that SID LA has separate \"account managers\" for the involved congressionalcommittees. Office personnel usually attend SID briefings to the congressional staffs andcommittees and provide feedback on these sessions to SID leadership. They can then providebackground information as to the tone and context surrounding follow-on queries fromCongress. (U//FOUO) For further information on how NSA LAO interacts with Congress, see their web pageat \"go lao\".\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 11/28/2003<br><br>(U) Leadership is about working with people and it really starts with how you look at them - how<br>you judge their motivation and their basic qualities.

Of course, this doesn't mean we aren't competitive. I saw riding<br>lawn mower races on TV last week. Jeesh! We'll race anything that moves! But we will<br>have rules and demand that they are adhered to even as we do our best to beat out the<br>other guy. It is a pretty good combination to have basic goodness and a competitive<br>spirit. Naturally, there needs to be balance in this (like so many things). When these get<br>out of balance, things do not go well. Leadership plays a role in keeping that balance for<br>the leader as well as the \"led\".<br>(U) Second lesson: people are not perfect . Yeah, I know this is not news, but why then do we<br>have so much trouble accepting people as imperfect and forgiving honest mistakes? The fact is<br>that, overall, people have a very low bit error rate. We make thousands of decisions every day<br>and put in tons of honest effort and rarely make many mistakes. Even when we do, there are<br>lots of external factors helping to share the blame. The really good news is that we are almost<br>always working in a team environment where one mistake can be easily made up for by the rest<br>of the team. The likelihood of the whole team all making a mistake simultaneously is just about<br>absolute zero. Even just two people teaming up bring the chances of a major screw up to<br>somewhere around nil.<br>(U) Second related revelation: we have to find a way to flexibly try out new ideas, and<br>team up to prevent the stinkers from having too much of an effect. By the way, making a<br>mistake is an active notion. Doing nothing is the only surefire way to avoid mistakes. I<br>like the concept of an engaged, active person trying out new ideas and occasionally<br>making a mistake, more than the potted plant that never makes one. Leaders create an<br>atmosphere where the active person constantly innovates safely. Leaders constantly<br>foster the notion of mutual support.

Unlike Lake Wobegone where all the women<br>are strong, the men are good looking and the children are all above average, there are some<br>people who are not performing well. Yes, it really is true. The good news is that the ratio is not<br>too bad. My experience is that around 95% of the people are doing well and meet the standards<br>for performance and conduct. This is a very good thing.

Co-located with the U.S. Army's bio-weapons research facility at Fort<br>Detrick, Maryland, AFMIC's primary mission is to prepare all-source medical intelligence, largely<br>in support of force health protection. The International Organizations Branch exploits and reports<br>the communications of non-governmental (NGO) and treaty monitoring organizations worldwide.<br>(TS//SI) What do AFMIC and the International Organizations Branch have in common? Quite a<br>lot. Several international NGOs regularly report outbreaks of infectious diseases; recent high<br>profile examples include SARS in China, cholera in Liberia, and dysentery, polio, and cholera in<br>Iraq - topics of great interest to AFMIC and by extension, the Intelligence Community.<br>Homegrown expertise and sufficient resources at NSA to process medical SIGINT are scarce<br>however, and as a result, unique and valuable medical intelligence - especially on lower<br>threshold topics - may go unreported.<br>(TS//SI) Once apprised in late 2002 of the limitations that prevent NSA from aggressively<br>reporting medical SIGINT, AFMIC quickly offered to detail a technical expert in epidemiology<br>part-time to help address this intelligence gap. At the same time, the Target Office of Primary<br>Interest (TOPI) worked closely with NSA's Office of Oversight and Compliance , the Office of<br>General Counsel , and others to address concerns about part-time integration. The AFMIC<br>analyst arrived in April 2003, took several NCS reporting courses and was ready for action by<br>early May. After being indoctrinated in USSID 18 and EO 12333, he was allowed access to<br>unminimized SIGINT data (or raw traffic) in select databases, and began authoring reports<br>almost immediately.<br>(TS//SI) The timing of the integree's arrival, as it coincided with a worldwide SARS epidemic,<br>could not have been better.

Co-located with the U.S. Army's bio-weapons research facility at FortDetrick, Maryland, AFMIC's primary mission is to prepare all-source medical intelligence, largelyin support of force health protection. The International Organizations Branch exploits and reportsthe communications of non-governmental (NGO) and treaty monitoring organizations worldwide.(TS//SI) What do AFMIC and the International Organizations Branch have in common? Quite alot. Several international NGOs regularly report outbreaks of infectious diseases; recent highprofile examples include SARS in China, cholera in Liberia, and dysentery, polio, and cholera inIraq - topics of great interest to AFMIC and by extension, the Intelligence Community.Homegrown expertise and sufficient resources at NSA to process medical SIGINT are scarcehowever, and as a result, unique and valuable medical intelligence - especially on lowerthreshold topics - may go unreported.(TS//SI) Once apprised in late 2002 of the limitations that prevent NSA from aggressivelyreporting medical SIGINT, AFMIC quickly offered to detail a technical expert in epidemiologypart-time to help address this intelligence gap. At the same time, the Target Office of PrimaryInterest (TOPI) worked closely with NSA's Office of Oversight and Compliance , the Office ofGeneral Counsel , and others to address concerns about part-time integration. The AFMICanalyst arrived in April 2003, took several NCS reporting courses and was ready for action byearly May. After being indoctrinated in USSID 18 and EO 12333, he was allowed access tounminimized SIGINT data (or raw traffic) in select databases, and began authoring reportsalmost immediately.(TS//SI) The timing of the integree's arrival, as it coincided with a worldwide SARS epidemic,could not have been better. While the quality of NSA reporting on SARS last spring was alreadyhigh, ready access to an in-house expert on infectious diseases who could effectively fieldanalysts' questions was tremendously beneficial. In addition, the partnership has generatedunique SIGINT reporting that supports the larger DoD and Intelligence Communities, an overallrefinement of the TOPI's efforts against complex public health targets, and a heightenedawareness among SID analysts of the value of medical SIGINT. Furthermore, his efforts todevelop related topics will inform and facilitate future endeavors to exploit medical intelligence inthe International Organizations Branch.(U//FOUO) In today's high-volume and highly specialized SIGINT environment, NSA mustengage its partners to make maximum use of community analytic resources.

Principalduties include functioning as the primary NSA/CSS liaison to the commander, JTF-GTMO and J2, JTF-GTMO. The NSALNO GTMO will coordinate with the JTF-GTMO Detention FacilityInterrogators to collect information of value to the NSA Enterprise and Extended Enterprise. TheNSALNO GTMO will have daily opportunities to work with inter-agency interrogators, to includethe CIA and FBI.(S//REL) Since JTF-GTMO is a \"collector and producer\" of intelligence, the NSALNO GTMO will bethe Senior NSA Representative in GTMO responsible for interfacing with DoD, CIA, and FBIinterrogators on a daily basis in order to assess and exploit information sourced from detainees.Other NSALNO GTMO responsibilities will include fostering a close working relationship with DoDand inter-agency senior interrogators in order to build an interactive trust and gain personalinsights inherent to the exploitation of detainees. (S//REL) The NSALNO GTMO will interface with NSA on a daily basis through contacts withNSOC, the CT Watch Officer located within the CT Product Line, and through other establishedpoints of entry for customers to submit RFI's, requests for sanitized text, etc., to assistJTF/GTMO interrogation efforts. On a case-by-case basis and with NSAW approval, the NSALNOGTMO will provide sensitive NSA-collected technical data and products to assist JTF-GTMOinterrogation efforts. The NSALNO GTMO works a normal day schedule, since JTF-GTMO is not a24-hour/7-day a week operation, but will need to work extended hours as required.(U//FOUO) This is an excellent opportunity to directly support the global war on terrorism andbecome involved in NSA's planning and execution in support of current military and non-militaryoperations. In this position you will make significant impacts on Cryptologic support to deployedmilitary forces.(U//FOUO) Information on position: Lt Colnsa, (U//FOUO) TO APPLY: Interested parties should send a resume to and Deployment Services,@nsa.@nsa,\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

In Australia, the NSA-Defence Signals<br>Directorate (DSD) relationship is the strongest and most longstanding of the bilateral intelligence relationships and serves as an<br>example for other agencies. SUSLOC is a vital part of the U.S.<br>Embassy, Canberra, community; the chief is a member of the<br>Australia Country Team and takes part in daily intelligence<br>meetings with the Ambassador and senior staff. The recentlyestablished Associate SUSLOC position in Wellington will help<br>establish closer ties with the U.S. Embassy in New Zealand. The<br>A/SUSLOC position provides both liaison and technical support for<br>many areas of cooperation between NSA and New Zealand's<br>Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).<br>(C) The United States and Australia have been drawn together<br>dramatically in recent years as a result of increased concerns over<br>terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and weapons of mass destruction.<br>Australia has supported all major U.S. initiatives, providing force<br>protection for U.S. troops in the area and deploying troops in<br>Afghanistan and Iraq. Examples of ongoing efforts include<br>cooperation with Australian authorities to ensure security and<br>secure communications for the October visit to Australia by the<br>U.S. President, joint efforts to counteract threats to the upcoming<br>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Bangkok, and<br>U.S. assistance to DSD following the October 2002 Bali bombing.<br>(S//SI) We cooperate with DSD and GCSB in major areas such as<br>reporting, collection, SIGINT development, counterterrorism,<br>information assurance, ELINT, cryptology, and sensitive areas like<br>close access. NSA and DSD worked together to support military<br>operations during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi<br>Freedom. Significant examples include OCMC and GEOCELL support<br>to DSD and the Australian Special Air Service, SSA support to DSD<br>for possible Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations, sharing<br>of Blue Force tracking, and integration of Australians into the CSG<br>in Baghdad. A continuing success story is the provision and<br>exchange of linguists among U.S., Australian, and New Zealand<br>cryptologic platforms to include ships and aircraft.<br>(TS//SI) Other areas where we are expanding cooperation with<br>DSD include reverse engineering: NSA integrees mentor both<br>cryptomathematicians and engineers while tackling the encrypted<br>Very Small Aperature Terminal (VSAT) network used by the Papua<br>New Guinea Defence Force, a goal mentioned in the DSD Director's<br>business plan. Another notable success highlights close NSA and<br>DSD cooperation on counterterrrorism, resulting in SIGINT reports<br>tying high value targets in the Middle East and the Philippines to<br>extremists in Southeast Asia. These reports led to a number of<br>terrorists being detained in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.

In Australia, the NSA-Defence SignalsDirectorate (DSD) relationship is the strongest and most longstanding of the bilateral intelligence relationships and serves as anexample for other agencies. SUSLOC is a vital part of the U.S.Embassy, Canberra, community; the chief is a member of theAustralia Country Team and takes part in daily intelligencemeetings with the Ambassador and senior staff. The recentlyestablished Associate SUSLOC position in Wellington will helpestablish closer ties with the U.S. Embassy in New Zealand. TheA/SUSLOC position provides both liaison and technical support formany areas of cooperation between NSA and New Zealand'sGovernment Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).(C) The United States and Australia have been drawn togetherdramatically in recent years as a result of increased concerns overterrorism, nuclear proliferation, and weapons of mass destruction.Australia has supported all major U.S. initiatives, providing forceprotection for U.S. troops in the area and deploying troops inAfghanistan and Iraq. Examples of ongoing efforts includecooperation with Australian authorities to ensure security andsecure communications for the October visit to Australia by theU.S. President, joint efforts to counteract threats to the upcomingAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Bangkok, andU.S. assistance to DSD following the October 2002 Bali bombing.(S//SI) We cooperate with DSD and GCSB in major areas such asreporting, collection, SIGINT development, counterterrorism,information assurance, ELINT, cryptology, and sensitive areas likeclose access. NSA and DSD worked together to support militaryoperations during Operations Enduring Freedom and IraqiFreedom. Significant examples include OCMC and GEOCELL supportto DSD and the Australian Special Air Service, SSA support to DSDfor possible Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations, sharingof Blue Force tracking, and integration of Australians into the CSGin Baghdad. A continuing success story is the provision andexchange of linguists among U.S., Australian, and New Zealandcryptologic platforms to include ships and aircraft.(TS//SI) Other areas where we are expanding cooperation withDSD include reverse engineering: NSA integrees mentor bothcryptomathematicians and engineers while tackling the encryptedVery Small Aperature Terminal (VSAT) network used by the PapuaNew Guinea Defence Force, a goal mentioned in the DSD Director'sbusiness plan. Another notable success highlights close NSA andDSD cooperation on counterterrrorism, resulting in SIGINT reportstying high value targets in the Middle East and the Philippines toextremists in Southeast Asia. These reports led to a number ofterrorists being detained in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. GCSB isworking closely with NSA and DSD to track terrorists in the region SERIES: (U//FOUO) Second PartySIGINT Cooperation1.  SIGINT Directors SetStrategic Directionfor 5-Eyes SIGINTEnterprise2.

In this environment, the ARC provides the on-the-job training needed to<br>certify the NIST teams in advance of their deployment. The MOC is teaming with the 704th<br>Army Technical Control and Analysis Element (ATCAE) and the 70th Intelligence Wing, Air Force<br>National Tactical Integration, to bolster the effectiveness of the ARC. In addition, the ARC will<br>support Task Force 20, and the NISTs in Afghanistan and Baghdad with first level metadata<br>analysis in order to focus collection, filter, and nominate voice content for exploitation.<br>(S) The HPCP Analysis Cell<br>(S//SI) Under the direction of SIGINT Strategy and Governance, the MOC on 27 May 2003 stood<br>up the HPCP (High-Powered Cordless Phone) Analysis Cell (HAC) to provide the community a<br>focal point for HPCP issues concerning collection, processing, dataflow, analysis and reporting.<br>The three main thrusts of the HAC are 1) documenting the Tactics Techniques and Procedures<br>for how to prosecute HPCP, using Syria as the test bed; 2) accepting and answering Requests for<br>Information (RFI) from the field; and 3) working dataflow issues with the ATCAE and MENA<br>SIGDEV to get ground sensor collection into the national databases. Also, under the sponsorship<br>of SIGINT Strategy and Governance (SSG) the MOC will host an HPCP Worldwide Conference in<br>the Fall.<br>(S) Special Access Cell<br>(TS//SI) Teaming with Special Source Operations (SSO), the Special Access Cell performs<br>environmental analysis of the global information infrastructure with a focus on international<br>communications to enable future access options. In addition, the MOC will validate and<br>characterize TELEX information from various sources and is responsible for minimizing USSID 18<br>violations, analyzing the TELEX bearers on a canal-by-canal basis, and ensuring that the<br>dictionary is effectively identifying the TELEX traffic. This activity has opened up new avenues of<br>collection previously unavailable to target offices at NSA.<br>(C) The SIGINT Development Division<br>(TS//SI) The SIGINT Development Division (SDD) is working with Corporate HF Services (CHS),<br>in direct response to a requirement to survey the HF environment in the Konar Valley,<br>Afghanistan where Special Forces units have been compromised. CHS is installing an HF<br>wideband collection system (SUPERCODING) at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan. The MOC will be<br>tasked to conduct search and survey of the HF environment to determine what communications<br>modes are in use.<br>(TS//SI) The SDD has teamed with the Kunia Regional SIGINT Operations Center (KRSOC) in<br>project Long Stare to identify unidentified signals emanating from North Korea. SDD was also<br>tasked by Cryptologic Exploitation Service (CES) to validate unidentified signals from North<br>Korea from overhead assets.<br>(S//SI) Additionally, the SDD is <br>, and is conducting HF search and survey looking for United Nations (UN) and NonGovernmental Organizations (NGO) in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and Liberia with a<br>focus toward force protection.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=\".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0\" class=\"SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph\">(U) Collection Development Cell<br>(S//SI) A new project for the SDD is to create an increased focus on training with regard to<br>signals development, search, and analysis. In the Collection Development Cell (CDC), the MOC is<br>teaming some of the most experienced collectors with, in some cases, new collection personnel<br>to provide intense on-the-job training on the wide variety of collection equipment and signals<br>processors available in the SDD. This effort complements the ever-increasing role in HF Signals<br>Development, and helps overcome a shortage of highly qualified personnel.<br>(C) Tactical Radio Exploitation Cell<br>(S//SI) The Tactical Radio Exploitation Cell (TREC) is the newest growth area for the MOC. The<br>TREC will incorporate all the accesses available to document the tactical radio environment into<br>a centralized and focused database. This longstanding requirement from SID will finally be<br>realized in the MOC.<br>(U) Additional Activities<br>(S//SI) Expanding on its current role as a test bed for new capabilities, the Director envisions<br>the MOC as a developmental platform for tactics, techniques, procedures, tools, systems, and<br>ideas that can then be exported to the Regional Security Operations Centers or the Mission<br>Ground Stations. This transformation of the MOC's mission will allow it to more effectively<br>support the SCEs' need to transform the skills of their workforce to deal with current and future<br>technologies, by providing a training and operational environment that is suitable for skills<br>development.<br>(S//SI) Internally, the MOC has reorganized its structure to mirror that of field stations, with an<br>Operations and a Support element. It has moved to a common shift scheduled to promote unit<br>cohesiveness, and has established analysis and training organizations to support its new<br>missions.

In addition, the ARC willsupport Task Force 20, and the NISTs in Afghanistan and Baghdad with first level metadataanalysis in order to focus collection, filter, and nominate voice content for exploitation.(S) The HPCP Analysis Cell(S//SI) Under the direction of SIGINT Strategy and Governance, the MOC on 27 May 2003 stoodup the HPCP (High-Powered Cordless Phone) Analysis Cell (HAC) to provide the community afocal point for HPCP issues concerning collection, processing, dataflow, analysis and reporting.The three main thrusts of the HAC are 1) documenting the Tactics Techniques and Proceduresfor how to prosecute HPCP, using Syria as the test bed; 2) accepting and answering Requests forInformation (RFI) from the field; and 3) working dataflow issues with the ATCAE and MENASIGDEV to get ground sensor collection into the national databases. Also, under the sponsorshipof SIGINT Strategy and Governance (SSG) the MOC will host an HPCP Worldwide Conference inthe Fall.(S) Special Access Cell(TS//SI) Teaming with Special Source Operations (SSO), the Special Access Cell performsenvironmental analysis of the global information infrastructure with a focus on internationalcommunications to enable future access options. In addition, the MOC will validate andcharacterize TELEX information from various sources and is responsible for minimizing USSID 18violations, analyzing the TELEX bearers on a canal-by-canal basis, and ensuring that thedictionary is effectively identifying the TELEX traffic. This activity has opened up new avenues ofcollection previously unavailable to target offices at NSA.(C) The SIGINT Development Division(TS//SI) The SIGINT Development Division (SDD) is working with Corporate HF Services (CHS),in direct response to a requirement to survey the HF environment in the Konar Valley,Afghanistan where Special Forces units have been compromised. CHS is installing an HFwideband collection system (SUPERCODING) at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan. The MOC will betasked to conduct search and survey of the HF environment to determine what communicationsmodes are in use.(TS//SI) The SDD has teamed with the Kunia Regional SIGINT Operations Center (KRSOC) inproject Long Stare to identify unidentified signals emanating from North Korea. SDD was alsotasked by Cryptologic Exploitation Service (CES) to validate unidentified signals from NorthKorea from overhead assets.(S//SI) Additionally, the SDD is , and is conducting HF search and survey looking for United Nations (UN) and NonGovernmental Organizations (NGO) in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and Liberia with afocus toward force protection. (U) Collection Development Cell(S//SI) A new project for the SDD is to create an increased focus on training with regard tosignals development, search, and analysis. In the Collection Development Cell (CDC), the MOC isteaming some of the most experienced collectors with, in some cases, new collection personnelto provide intense on-the-job training on the wide variety of collection equipment and signalsprocessors available in the SDD. This effort complements the ever-increasing role in HF SignalsDevelopment, and helps overcome a shortage of highly qualified personnel.(C) Tactical Radio Exploitation Cell(S//SI) The Tactical Radio Exploitation Cell (TREC) is the newest growth area for the MOC. TheTREC will incorporate all the accesses available to document the tactical radio environment intoa centralized and focused database. This longstanding requirement from SID will finally berealized in the MOC.(U) Additional Activities(S//SI) Expanding on its current role as a test bed for new capabilities, the Director envisionsthe MOC as a developmental platform for tactics, techniques, procedures, tools, systems, andideas that can then be exported to the Regional Security Operations Centers or the MissionGround Stations. This transformation of the MOC's mission will allow it to more effectivelysupport the SCEs' need to transform the skills of their workforce to deal with current and futuretechnologies, by providing a training and operational environment that is suitable for skillsdevelopment.(S//SI) Internally, the MOC has reorganized its structure to mirror that of field stations, with anOperations and a Support element. It has moved to a common shift scheduled to promote unitcohesiveness, and has established analysis and training organizations to support its newmissions. The MOC is well on its way to establishing itself as a valuable component of theAgency's SIGDEV arsenal.(U//FOUO) For more information on our transition, please visit our website at \"go moc.\"\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

Armed with a 9mm pistol and an M16 rifle that I<br>prayed I would never have to use, I rode the whole way in a fiveton truck, with easy access to thermite grenades that could be<br>used to destroy our classified cargo in the event of an ambush. We<br>passed many Iraqi civilians - some waving American flags, some<br>begging for food or trying to sell something, but most just<br>watching in apparent awe as our trucks and humvees passed. We<br>also saw numerous Iraqi tanks, rocket launchers, and personnel<br>carriers that had been destroyed by US troops and aircraft as they<br>advanced toward the capital city. Aside from frequent stops for<br>repairs and fuel, we had a fairly uneventful trip to Camp Victory,<br>Baghdad.<br>Convoy to Iraq<br><br> <br><br>(U//FOUO) Our new home was in one of Saddam's former palace<br>complexes located just east of Baghdad International Airport.<br>Unfortunately, other than the change of scenery and the<br>permanent structures in which we worked, this new facility offered<br>almost no advantages over our makeshift tent camp back in<br>Kuwait. We ate nothing but MREs for the six weeks we were in<br>Iraq, and many times we were rationed two MREs and two bottles<br>of water per day. When we first arrived I went almost two weeks<br>without a shower, and for several weeks our restroom was a small<br>tent surrounding six metal drums covered by plastic toilet seats<br>and separated by small sheets. At that point I was working nights<br>and trying to sleep during the day. This proved to be extremely<br>difficult since temperatures routinely reached 110 degrees and we<br>did not have any electricity in our tent for air conditioning or even<br>fans, so I found myself averaging about two or three hours of sleep<br>per day. We often heard explosions and saw tracer fire or smoke<br>coming from the direction of downtown Baghdad, but I felt<br>relatively safe inside of our heavily guarded compound. The<br>conditions gradually improved as more people settled into the<br>camp. Eventually the metal drums were replaced by porta-johns<br>and we found a clean water source for showers and a generator for<br>fans in the tent.<br> <br>One of Saddam's former palaces in Baghdad<br>(U//FOUO) I took advantage of any opportunity I had to leave<br>Camp Victory and experience as much of the country and the<br>culture as I could.

Armed with a 9mm pistol and an M16 rifle that Iprayed I would never have to use, I rode the whole way in a fiveton truck, with easy access to thermite grenades that could beused to destroy our classified cargo in the event of an ambush. Wepassed many Iraqi civilians - some waving American flags, somebegging for food or trying to sell something, but most justwatching in apparent awe as our trucks and humvees passed. Wealso saw numerous Iraqi tanks, rocket launchers, and personnelcarriers that had been destroyed by US troops and aircraft as theyadvanced toward the capital city. Aside from frequent stops forrepairs and fuel, we had a fairly uneventful trip to Camp Victory,Baghdad.Convoy to Iraq (U//FOUO) Our new home was in one of Saddam's former palacecomplexes located just east of Baghdad International Airport.Unfortunately, other than the change of scenery and thepermanent structures in which we worked, this new facility offeredalmost no advantages over our makeshift tent camp back inKuwait. We ate nothing but MREs for the six weeks we were inIraq, and many times we were rationed two MREs and two bottlesof water per day. When we first arrived I went almost two weekswithout a shower, and for several weeks our restroom was a smalltent surrounding six metal drums covered by plastic toilet seatsand separated by small sheets. At that point I was working nightsand trying to sleep during the day. This proved to be extremelydifficult since temperatures routinely reached 110 degrees and wedid not have any electricity in our tent for air conditioning or evenfans, so I found myself averaging about two or three hours of sleepper day. We often heard explosions and saw tracer fire or smokecoming from the direction of downtown Baghdad, but I feltrelatively safe inside of our heavily guarded compound. Theconditions gradually improved as more people settled into thecamp. Eventually the metal drums were replaced by porta-johnsand we found a clean water source for showers and a generator forfans in the tent. One of Saddam's former palaces in Baghdad(U//FOUO) I took advantage of any opportunity I had to leaveCamp Victory and experience as much of the country and theculture as I could.

As members of the Counterterrorism IMT, we<br>want to share some of the things we are doing, to further educate you about IMTs in general,<br>but more importantly for us, to make you aware of some of the challenges we face, and if at all<br>appropriate, invite you to the corporate CT table.<br>(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Director has challenged the CT IMT to be the corporate conscience and<br>advocate for all that the United States SIGINT System (USSS) can bring to bear in the Global<br>War on Terror (GWOT). In this context, we are no different from the other IMTs. We have been<br>charged to optimize the USSS for our mission areas, to synchronize CT-related activities by<br>working to improve processes and fostering collaborative partnerships, and by striving to meet<br>the Agency's broader goals as defined by Transformation 2.0 and other initiatives. There is a<br>natural fit between the goals of infosharing and horizontal integration and the CT IMT's<br>objectives; they are, in fact, prerequisites for winning the GWOT.<br>(S//SI) To ensure the USSS is maximized to win the War on Terror, the CT IMT must collaborate<br>with myriad groups, organizations, and individuals. We are discovering that collaboration and<br>the sharing of information is critical for doing business. Not only must we strive for \"joined at<br>the hip\" partnerships with the organizations that have obvious CT roles to play, but we must<br>also make every effort to include, when appropriate, other partners whose roles may not be so<br>obvious. We have been challenged to make compelling cases for change by working with and<br>through the existing traditional organizational framework. We must partner with leaders across<br>SID on ways to improve our CT capabilities without undermining existing authorities or decisionmaking responsibilities. To ensure that expertise and energy are applied effectively for<br>maximum benefit to the mission the CT IMT created the Counterterrorism Planning Group<br>(CTPG). With representatives from across SID, IAD, and the Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)<br>the CTPG has the capability to reach far across and deep into the Enterprise. It is poised to get<br>the right experts and leaders together quickly to define and resolve CT-related issues, to<br>recognize challenges, and to break down barriers in order to seize opportunities and implement<br>creative solutions.<br>(S//SI) The CT IMT is currently working on an Operations Plan (OPLAN) to capture all the<br>excellent and worthwhile efforts that were underway in the CT arena before the IMT was<br>established.

As members of the Counterterrorism IMT, wewant to share some of the things we are doing, to further educate you about IMTs in general,but more importantly for us, to make you aware of some of the challenges we face, and if at allappropriate, invite you to the corporate CT table.(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Director has challenged the CT IMT to be the corporate conscience andadvocate for all that the United States SIGINT System (USSS) can bring to bear in the GlobalWar on Terror (GWOT). In this context, we are no different from the other IMTs. We have beencharged to optimize the USSS for our mission areas, to synchronize CT-related activities byworking to improve processes and fostering collaborative partnerships, and by striving to meetthe Agency's broader goals as defined by Transformation 2.0 and other initiatives. There is anatural fit between the goals of infosharing and horizontal integration and the CT IMT'sobjectives; they are, in fact, prerequisites for winning the GWOT.(S//SI) To ensure the USSS is maximized to win the War on Terror, the CT IMT must collaboratewith myriad groups, organizations, and individuals. We are discovering that collaboration andthe sharing of information is critical for doing business. Not only must we strive for \"joined atthe hip\" partnerships with the organizations that have obvious CT roles to play, but we mustalso make every effort to include, when appropriate, other partners whose roles may not be soobvious. We have been challenged to make compelling cases for change by working with andthrough the existing traditional organizational framework. We must partner with leaders acrossSID on ways to improve our CT capabilities without undermining existing authorities or decisionmaking responsibilities. To ensure that expertise and energy are applied effectively formaximum benefit to the mission the CT IMT created the Counterterrorism Planning Group(CTPG). With representatives from across SID, IAD, and the Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)the CTPG has the capability to reach far across and deep into the Enterprise. It is poised to getthe right experts and leaders together quickly to define and resolve CT-related issues, torecognize challenges, and to break down barriers in order to seize opportunities and implementcreative solutions.(S//SI) The CT IMT is currently working on an Operations Plan (OPLAN) to capture all theexcellent and worthwhile efforts that were underway in the CT arena before the IMT wasestablished. We are also working with the SIGINT Director and SID Staff to follow up on CTrelated issues that surfaced during the recent Site Commanders Operational Review (SCOR);getting involved in understanding and representing SID and NSA in CT budget-relatedprocesses; working with FAD to identify key CT gaps that could lead to new or changed foreignpartnerships; and supporting and steering corporate activities as they relate to Counterterrorism(a recent CT assessment requested by the Pentagon is one example).(U//FOUO) It is the global nature of the terrorist threat that makes it such a challenge for theSIGINT system. How do we posture the best SIGINT collection capability in the world to win thiswar? How can we better support our extraordinarily talented cadre of SIGINT Developers,language analysts and analyst-reporters so they can stop \"sprinting\" (as many of them havebeen doing since 9/11) and poise themselves to win the long haul \"marathon\" the GWOTdemands? How can we better partner with support organizations in the GWOT as they struggleto meet their own constantly-changing set of competing priorities?

A UN presence! The United Nations<br>touches every region of the world and UN representatives, missions, and organizations are<br>involved in the resolution of most of the major intra- and interstate conflicts across the globe.

A UN presence! The United Nationstouches every region of the world and UN representatives, missions, and organizations areinvolved in the resolution of most of the major intra- and interstate conflicts across the globe. Itis in the United Nations that 191 member countries come together and work to resolve suchcritical global issues as HIV/AIDS, non-proliferation, hunger, and organized crime and narcotics.(S//SI) The shift from a bi-polar, Euro-centric world to a single superpower amid a sea ofnational and regional entities vying for increased global prominence, in an era of increasingtransnational threats, offers serious challenges for the post-World War II construct that is theUnited Nations.

Working closely with NSA's Office of General Counsel (the Agency<br>lead), we anticipate the National Commission's interests or concerns and alert folks in SID to<br>information they may be asked to provide.

With few exceptions, National<br>Commission staffers are not SIGINTers by trade. So, all of these briefings and discussions have<br>given them valuable insight into our business and an appreciation for the complexities of our<br>work!

Damage assessment : Al-Qaeda initially heightened their security awareness andpractices, then in December 2001, the source went off the air, creating a significantcollection gap.(U) ...but leaks are not limited to the topic of al-Qaeda:-- (TS//SI) A December 2002 WorldNetDaily.com article, while it did not provide specificclassified information based on SIGINT product, did provide an accurate and unauthorized disclosure of NSA's capabilities. Specifically, the article indicated that NSA had lost its ability tocollect information on activities in Iran, thus disclosing a collection gap on a high-priority targetfor the United States. The article was released shortly after we lost collection of IranianIntelligence Service communications. Damage assessment : Vulnerabilities in our abilities against a high-interest target wererevealed. Follow-on action : NSA's Office of General Counsel issued a formal report to the U.S.Department of Justice of the unauthorized disclosure of COMINT information and requested afollow-on FBI investigation. The unauthorized disclosure of COMINT information represents acriminal violation and is subject to FBI investigation as such.(U//FOUO) Coming in part two of this article: What happens when CIs are discovered, and whatis your role?\"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANetwithout the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms).\"DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION ISTOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZLDERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108 "

This new policy governs the provision of NSA-collected information to CIA under CIA's<br>NSCID 5 (\"U.S. Espionage and Counterintelligence Activities Abroad\") authorities. In 1972,<br>NSCID 5 established the authority of CIA to engage in SIGINT activities in support of its<br>clandestine espionage and counterintelligence activities (HUMINT and Covert Operations)<br>abroad. Deliberate and measured applications of this authority have been a key part of our<br>relationship with CIA and have been an important part of mission success in a number of areas.<br>(S//SI) The power and impact of SIGINT, especially as seen in the Global War on Terrorism and<br>most recently in Operation Iraqi Freedom, have increased the demand for SIGINT support to<br>these HUMINT and Covert Operations.

This new policy governs the provision of NSA-collected information to CIA under CIA'sNSCID 5 (\"U.S. Espionage and Counterintelligence Activities Abroad\") authorities. In 1972,NSCID 5 established the authority of CIA to engage in SIGINT activities in support of itsclandestine espionage and counterintelligence activities (HUMINT and Covert Operations)abroad. Deliberate and measured applications of this authority have been a key part of ourrelationship with CIA and have been an important part of mission success in a number of areas.(S//SI) The power and impact of SIGINT, especially as seen in the Global War on Terrorism andmost recently in Operation Iraqi Freedom, have increased the demand for SIGINT support tothese HUMINT and Covert Operations.

This new policy, inessence, defines how we will provide NSA-collected, unminimized** SIGINT to CIA for them touse in direct support of certain aspects of their mission. It also establishes clear procedures forhow NSA and CIA will handle NSCID 5 support interactions; NSA's focal point for these requestswill be the Customer Gateway organization.(S//SI) We have been working with all concerned to document the policy on NSA's provision ofNSCID 5 SIGINT support to CIA (NSA/CSS Policy No. 2-11) and the attendant procedures(USSID 180(P)) .

Although the first race,<br>dive, and somersault are still a year away, the Intelligence Community is already in full \"training<br>mode\" for the event. In truth, NSA has been gearing up for the 2004 Olympics for quite some<br>time, in anticipation of playing a larger role than ever before at the international games.<br>(U) Prior Games<br>(S) The first phase of preparation actually began years ago through the involvement of NSA with<br>the Olympic Games in other cities. NSA has had an active role in the Olympics since the 1984<br>Los Angeles games, and has seen its involvement increase with the recent games in Atlanta,<br>Sydney, and Salt Lake City. During the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the focus was on<br>counterterrorism, and NSA acted largely in support of the FBI in a fusion cell known as the<br>Olympics Intelligence Center (OIC). The mission of the OIC was to fuse foreign intelligence and<br>law enforcement information to provide threat warning and situation awareness before and<br>during the games. NSA's support to the 2004 Olympics in Athens will be much more<br>complicated.<br>(U) The Athens Outlook<br>(S//SI) Several factors will make the Athens Olympics vastly different, not the least of which is<br>the fact these Olympics will not be held at a domestic location. Also different is that the security<br>organization that NSA will support is the EYP, or Greek National Intelligence Service. NSA will<br>gather information and tip off the EYP of possible terrorist or criminal actions. Without a doubt,<br>the communication between NSA and EYP will take some coordination, and for that reason<br>preparations are already underway.<br>(S//SI) NSA, and SID in particular, will be sending the largest contingent of personnel in support<br>of the games in our history. A team of 10 NSA analysts will arrive in Greece anywhere from 3045 days before the Olympics and stay until the flame is extinguished to provide the best support<br>possible to the safety and security of the games. It is also important to note that preparations<br>are being made for our in-house support to the games. NSOC again will serve as the single<br>point of contact for the Olympics for our customers. Work is being done across SID to work with<br>customers to receive and understand their specific Information Needs. Data Acquisition, working<br>with SIGINT Development, the Target Offices of Primary Interest, and the extended SIGINT<br>Enterprise, is preparing a comprehensive Olympics Collection Strategy.

Although the first race,dive, and somersault are still a year away, the Intelligence Community is already in full \"trainingmode\" for the event. In truth, NSA has been gearing up for the 2004 Olympics for quite sometime, in anticipation of playing a larger role than ever before at the international games.(U) Prior Games(S) The first phase of preparation actually began years ago through the involvement of NSA withthe Olympic Games in other cities. NSA has had an active role in the Olympics since the 1984Los Angeles games, and has seen its involvement increase with the recent games in Atlanta,Sydney, and Salt Lake City. During the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the focus was oncounterterrorism, and NSA acted largely in support of the FBI in a fusion cell known as theOlympics Intelligence Center (OIC). The mission of the OIC was to fuse foreign intelligence andlaw enforcement information to provide threat warning and situation awareness before andduring the games. NSA's support to the 2004 Olympics in Athens will be much morecomplicated.(U) The Athens Outlook(S//SI) Several factors will make the Athens Olympics vastly different, not the least of which isthe fact these Olympics will not be held at a domestic location. Also different is that the securityorganization that NSA will support is the EYP, or Greek National Intelligence Service. NSA willgather information and tip off the EYP of possible terrorist or criminal actions. Without a doubt,the communication between NSA and EYP will take some coordination, and for that reasonpreparations are already underway.(S//SI) NSA, and SID in particular, will be sending the largest contingent of personnel in supportof the games in our history. A team of 10 NSA analysts will arrive in Greece anywhere from 3045 days before the Olympics and stay until the flame is extinguished to provide the best supportpossible to the safety and security of the games. It is also important to note that preparationsare being made for our in-house support to the games. NSOC again will serve as the singlepoint of contact for the Olympics for our customers. Work is being done across SID to work withcustomers to receive and understand their specific Information Needs. Data Acquisition, workingwith SIGINT Development, the Target Offices of Primary Interest, and the extended SIGINTEnterprise, is preparing a comprehensive Olympics Collection Strategy. Moreover, SID ispartnering with the Foreign Affairs Directorate to develop a strategy to share threat informationwith our SIGINT Partners.(U//FOUO) The Olympic Games are perhaps the greatest platform for global unity, even if it isfor just a short time; but they are also an enormous target for would-be evildoers. Thousandswill participate and billions will be watching as the games unfold. The scope of the Olympics istremendous, and so will be the support of SID and NSA.
