DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SID Holds Town Meeting<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 11/21/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Employees from across SID gathered on Thursday for a town meeting led by SIGINT<br>Director MG Quirk and his deputy, Charlie Meals. MG Quirk opened the meeting by describing<br>his trip to Iraq last week accompanied by Dr. Eric Haseltine, Chief of the Research Associate<br>Directorate (RAD), Jim Allen, SID's Deputy Director for Analysis &amp; Production,<br>,<br>Deputy Director for Data Acquisition and Ron Carback, Iraq Issue Manager. The SIGINT Director<br>noted that U.S. troops and coalition partners are doing "wonderful work" and called his visit<br>"inspiring." Our intelligence customers in Iraq, especially those at the tactical level, indicated<br>that SIGINT is critical to their mission, and urged NSA to keep up the good work. MGQ's twoway dialogue with the "clients" will allow us to collectively focus our efforts for an even better<br>outcome.<br>(S//SI) The second topic on the agenda was Transformation 2.0 - how is SID enacting the<br>principles DIRNSA has set before us? Mr. Meals took the opportunity to explain how the Issue<br>Management Teams are our way of addressing "horizontal integration," by functioning as<br>advocates for their particular issues. He also described SID's efforts to engage more closely with<br>our customers and U.S. Cryptologic System (USCS) colleagues.<br>(S//SI) Next, MG Quirk discussed the responsibilities of SID leadership, emphasizing that the<br>SID Deputy Directorate Chiefs need to oversee their functions (i.e. Customer Relationships,<br>Analysis &amp; Production and Data Acquisition) throughout the whole of the SIGINT Extended<br>Enterprise. To demonstrate the complexity of this system, the General drew the crowd's<br>attention to an organizational chart stretching much of the length of the auditorium wall, with<br>NSA Headquarters representing just one small part. He observed that the task confronting the<br>SID leadership team is to shift from running "Dad's hardware store" to serving on the board of<br>directors of Home Depot.<br>(U//FOUO) Mr. Meals then highlighted four SIGINT success stories before he and the General<br>took questions from the audience. In closing, MG Quirk stated that we must not be faint of heart<br>in supporting the War on Terrorism, but cautioned that this fight is likely to be a long one - a<br>marathon, not a sprint - and we must all work at a sustainable level. Finally, he thanked the<br>workforce for the great work they continue to do.<br>(U//FOUO) A link to the town meeting slides can be found in the "Latest News" box on the<br>SIDtoday homepage.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
