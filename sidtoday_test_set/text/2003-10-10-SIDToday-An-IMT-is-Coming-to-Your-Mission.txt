DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) An IMT is Coming to Your Mission!<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 10/10/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Last November, in preparation for support to Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Signals<br>Intelligence Directorate introduced the Issue Manager Team (IMT) construct. During Iraqi<br>Freedom operations, the Iraqi IMT proved invaluable in reaching across the SIGINT Enterprise to<br>work with customers, partners and operational entities to clarify and prioritize intelligence needs,<br>identify gaps in the U.S. SIGINT System, and to strategize solutions to optimize the SIGINT<br>system.<br>(S//SI) Capitalizing on the success of the IMT construct, we established four (4) additional IMTs<br>since February, they are: Korea , Counterterrorism, Proliferation/Weapons of Mass Destruction<br>(WMD) and Latin America. To date, it is clear that through the great dedication and skill of these<br>IMTs, we are gaining critical insights into ways to further optimize the SIGINT system. The men<br>and women who serve as IMT members have been essential in this pursuit -- they are truly<br>making a difference.<br>(U//FOUO) Recently we met with the DIRNSA and agreed to roll out the IMT construct on a<br>global scale. For all IMTs the goals are the same - - to facilitate gap analysis and the integration<br>of SIGINT activities across the SIGINT Enterprise and with customers, partners and stakeholders<br>for their issue; simply put -- to optimize our performance in each of these target areas. All<br>targets and issues do not require the same level of intensity and/or urgency at the same time.<br>Acknowledging this and being committed to using our resources responsibly, SID will be<br>implementing a tiered approach to IMTs.<br>(S//SI) The tiered approach takes into account that not all issues require three (3) full-time<br>issue managers like the IRAQ and CT teams. Some IMTs, after an initial 3-month stand-up<br>period, will have their members revert to part-time status and only go into full-time mode in<br>response to some preset schedule or in the event of a crisis. The part-time members keep their<br>regular positions in SID, working full-time on IMT duties only as needed. The three tiers are<br>defined as follows:<br>Tier 1 - "High Alert" Team - three full-time positions<br>Iraq<br>Counterterrorism<br>Tier 2 - "Significant Alert" Teams - one full-time and two part-time positions<br>Proliferation<br>Asia/Pacific<br>Information Operations<br>Tier 3 "Moderate Alert" Teams - three part-time positions<br>Europe/Russia<br>Africa<br>MENA/Stans/India/Pakistan<br>Latin America &amp; Caribbean<br>Weapons &amp; Space<br>Counternarcotics/Interanational Crime<br>Counterintelligence<br>Global Geopolitical Issues (Ecconomic/Social/Environmental)<br>(U//FOUO) While the SIGINT Leadership Team is currently working to define the IMT members,<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">in the future we plan to post IMT vacancies for competitive selection. As an IMT member you will<br>work closely with me and the rest of the SIGINT Leadership team to strengthen our response to<br>SIGINT challenges and inform our investment decision-making process. I encourage all GS-15s,<br>DISES and DISLs with operational SIGINT experience to consider becoming an IMT member in<br>the future. I am excited about our future and the steps we are taking with the IMTs. Our work<br>should also substantially contribute to implementing DIRNSA's Transformation 2.0 objectives. I<br>ask that you join me in working to implement this tiered approach and continue to improve our<br>response to customers' information needs.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
