DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Introducing Jim Allen, Incoming Deputy Director for Analysis and<br>Production<br>FROM: Jim Allen<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/17/2003<br>(U//FOUO) When the SIGINT Communications Team asked me to<br>describe my leadership style, I found myself thinking of those<br>attributes taught in courses and exhibited by superior leaders I<br>have observed. Some of those attributes are to know and act upon<br>what's important, to guide, empower, trust, communicate, to<br>encourage initiative and collaboration, and to provide a positive<br>example. I may adjust when required, and I may fall short on<br>occasion, but I am genuine in my commitment to these ideals;<br>you'll have ample opportunity to determine how close I come!<br>(U//FOUO) To round out the picture in terms that are a bit more<br>illustrative, I'll tell you as well that I believe it is my responsibility<br>to interpret and implement the Director's vision corporately and for<br>A&amp;P; specifically. I like consensus and will work to achieve it, but I<br>will make decisions without it. I want to build a team that executes<br>to a high standard of performance, with people at all levels<br>anticipating and embracing challenges, tackling those things that<br>matter most. That includes having each individual making<br>decisions as appropriate and not waiting or deferring<br>unnecessarily.<br>(U//FOUO) I want us to be open and honest, to feel confident, to<br>learn from all that we do and from the successes and failures of<br>others. I am sure these qualities are all central to the organization<br>I am joining, and I will do my best to strengthen and continue the<br>progress being made.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Getting to Know the<br>SID Leadership Team<br>1.
