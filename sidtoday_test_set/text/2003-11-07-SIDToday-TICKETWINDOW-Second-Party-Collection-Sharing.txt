When Data<br>(U//FOUO) Second Party<br>Acquisition researched these questions, they learned that NSA<br>SIGINT Cooperation<br>collects much data that is not shared with partners due to security<br>classifications.

Both GCHQ and CSE<br>have doubled their output of TICKETWINDOW-based reports in the<br>last year.
