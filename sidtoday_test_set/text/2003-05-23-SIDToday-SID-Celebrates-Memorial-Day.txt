DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Celebrates Memorial Day<br>FROM: CMSgt<br>SID Senior Enlisted Advisor<br>Run Date: 05/23/2003<br><br>(U) This Memorial Day millions of Americans will be enjoying time off with their families, taking<br>advantage of the spring weather to pull out the backyard grill or taking the kids to the<br>amusement park. Students will be making plans for their summer vacation while others will be<br>planting their gardens, shopping for bargains at the mall, or doing the spring-cleaning chores.<br>Regardless of what you have planned, you have the freedom to choose your activity because of<br>the men and women we honor on Memorial Day, a day set aside to remember the sacrifice of<br>those who died in all of our nation's wars.<br>(U) Most historians agree that the observance of Memorial Day was born of compassion and<br>empathy in 1863. As the Civil War raged, loved ones were cleaning Confederate soldiers' graves<br>in Columbus, Mississippi, placing flowers on them. They noticed nearby the Union soldiers<br>graves, dusty, overgrown with weeds. Grieving for their own fallen soldiers, the Confederate<br>women understood that the dead Union soldiers buried nearby were the cherished loved ones of<br>families and communities far away. They cleared the tangled brush and mud from those graves<br>as well as their own soldiers' graves and laid flowers on them all.<br>(U) Soon the tradition of a "Decoration Day" for the graves of fallen soldiers spread. On May 5,<br>1866, when the Civil War was over, Henry Welles of Waterloo, New York, closed his drugstore<br>and suggested that all other shops in town also close up for a day to honor all soldiers killed in<br>the Civil War, Union and Confederate alike. It was a gesture of healing and reconciliation in a<br>land ripped apart by conflict.<br>(U) Sixteen years later, in 1882, the nation observed its first official Memorial Day. Memorial Day<br>represents one day of national awareness and reverence, honoring those Americans who died<br>while defending our nation and its values. Since its beginnings, our country has faced many<br>threats that have tested its courage. From war-torn battlefields, conflicts at sea and air, to our<br>current global war against terrorism, generations of brave men and women have fought and died<br>to protect our democracy. Their sacrifices have made this nation strong and our world a better<br>place. While it's right that we should honor these heroes every day for the contribution they<br>have made to secure our nation's freedom, it's especially fitting that we remember them on<br>Memorial Day.<br>(U) When thinking about the true meaning of Memorial Day, the words of Charles M. Province<br>come to mind:<br>It is the Soldier, not the reporter, <br>Who has given us Freedom of the Press.<br>It is the Soldier, not the poet, <br>Who has given us Freedom of Speech.<br>It is the Soldier, not the campus organizer, <br>Who has given us the Freedom to demonstrate.<br>It is the Soldier, not the lawyer, <br>Who has given us the right to a fair trail.<br>And it is the Soldier--who salutes the flag, <br>Who serves the flag, and<br>Whose coffin is draped by the flag-- <br>Who allows the protester to burn the flag.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U) So what are your plans for Memorial Day? By all means enjoy your picnics and backyard<br>barbeque, the parades and baseball games or time with family and friends. But please also<br>remember to take time to reflect on the true meaning of Memorial Day. Something as simple as<br>observing the National Moment of Remembrance at 15:00 local time...a chance for all Americans<br>to pay tribute to those who placed country before self and paid the ultimate sacrifice for our<br>freedom. We owe them a debt of honor and gratitude.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
