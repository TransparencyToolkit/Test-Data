Initially, incoming intercept is "scanned" by<br>linguists searching for reportable or for database information on<br>new or existing targets. When information of interest is detected,<br>reporters are alerted immediately and the full text, a gist, or a<br>translation of the item in question may be generated.<br>(C) Next, the text's accuracy is checked by a senior linguist with<br>keen knowledge of the target's language and slang, of its culture,<br>and of any events affecting the situation. Only after this "quality<br>control" process is done is the "polished" intercept passed on to<br>the reporters. They then run it through a similar process of writing,<br>checking and verification, not only with senior reporters, but also<br>with the linguists who worked with the original items. With skilled<br>and dedicated linguists present, such seemingly toilsome process<br>can be completed within a relatively short time, if necessary.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) A Day in the Life of...<br>1.

Most of the time the intercept is unproductive;<br>nevertheless linguists keep "panning for gold" until they find it in<br>the form of actionable intelligence information. Then the true value<br>of a linguist becomes evident.
