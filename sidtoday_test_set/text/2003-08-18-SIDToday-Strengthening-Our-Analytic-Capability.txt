DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Strengthening Our Analytic Capability<br>FROM:<br>Acting Deputy Director for Analysis and Production<br>Run Date: 08/18/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Having spent the last 16 months in Analysis and<br>Production, I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand the<br>phenomenal job done by SIGINT analysts of all disciplines. From<br>my previous positions at CIA and on the National Security Council,<br>I know how important SIGINT was and is to our country's national<br>security. My time here and interaction with our customers has<br>deepened that appreciation. Our analysts have continually risen to<br>the challenges of our changing world and demanding customers<br>through their expertise, innovation, and sheer determination. We<br>owe them our gratitude, and we are working to provide them the<br>tradecraft training, analytic techniques, and tools they need to<br>keep us ahead of our targets. I am convinced that SIGINT analysis<br>and the analysts who perform it must be strongly supported and<br>that we must work continuously to make our product even better.<br>(U//FOUO) We have commissioned a number of teams to work<br>primarily in two areas: raising the tradecraft skills and expertise of<br>all our people and increasing the analytic value added of our<br>SIGINT product, whether it be end product to customers or SIGINT<br>development work. While these efforts should be understood as<br>continuous, with no obvious nirvana end-state, we are moving<br>ahead on some specific short term goals:<br>Under the auspices of our Advanced Analysis Lab, a group of<br>our senior analysts are writing a paper on just what<br>constitutes excellent analysis - and what are some of the<br>elements that make our products truly useful, relevant,<br>insightful and actionable. Through this paper we will set the<br>standards - the bar - for excellent analytic product.<br>Another team is developing a process for our experts to<br>identify "exemplars" of our best products - whether Social<br>Network analysis, a fused COMINT-Tech SIGINT report, an<br>in-depth special assessment, or another vehicle. We will put<br>examples of analysis that meet or exceed our standards for<br>excellence on our Advanced Analysis Labs 'best practices"<br>website.<br>While there is nothing as useful as having excellent models<br>to emulate, we are also working with the National<br>Cryptologic School to revamp our analysis training<br>curriculum in general and to develop a specific "high-end"<br>course for experienced analysts.<br>We are asking our Production Line managers to produce a<br>production plan, that is, to identify those critical issues<br>where we need analysts to research and write social<br>network analyses and a continuing stream of assessment<br>reports over the next year. Customer feedback from the<br>Iraq campaign has again highlighted how valuable<br>policymakers and warfighters find our analysis-rich<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Analysis<br>1.

We will measure how well we do.<br>And finally, we want to reward analytic achievement, and a<br>team has completed a proposal for some new Deputy<br>Director for Analysis and Production awards, including an<br>annual award for Analytic/Technical Excellence.<br>(U//FOUO) I hope you see that there is a method and deliberate<br>effort to emphasize the importance of our analytic value-added in<br>our products and services. As a prelude to our first annual Analysis<br>Conference , here at NSA from 25 to 28 August, we will present<br>over the next several days a series of articles highlighting analytic<br>techniques and learning opportunities. These articles only begin to<br>scratch the surface of the important, creative approaches our<br>analysts and second party colleagues are developing and<br>employing. The Conference will allow us to dig a little deeper and<br>to share the "best practices" that are being utilized in many<br>corners of our extended analytic enterprise. I encourage all of you<br>to attend the panel discussions, workshops, and briefings with an<br>eye toward how you can apply the knowledge and techniques<br>presented to your own target.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
