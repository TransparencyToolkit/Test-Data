DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) CANYONDUST Goes Global<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 09/25/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Sometimes a solution to a specific problem turns out to have wider applications than<br>originally intended. Take, for example, CANYONDUST, a ground-based INMARSAT geolocation<br>capability. It was originally intended to satisfy a significant analytic capabilities gap for the<br>Western Hemisphere narcotics target. It has proved so useful, however, that three additional<br>systems will be deployed this calendar year to cover the majority of landmass around the world.<br>(TS//SI) This effort will provide analysts with a 24/7 geolocation capability, will<br>enhance/compliment current overhead capabilities, and will provide considerable data for target<br>discovery efforts. Although it is not as accurate as Overhead (satellite-based) geolocation,<br>CANYONDUST is far less expensive and, used wisely, can greatly reduce the burden on the<br>limited Overhead resources. For example, CANYONDUST can carry out the preliminary legwork<br>in finding high-interest targets, at which time Overhead resources can then be steered to give a<br>more precise geolocation.<br>(TS//SI) The currently operational system at TIMBERLINE (the FORNSAT collection facility in<br>Sugar Grove, West Virginia) has provided results that have helped SID and GCHQ analysts<br>working the Counterterrorism, China and Korea, and narcotics targets. It performs about<br>250,000 terminal geolocations per day. While the system is being funded with primarily DCIP<br>(The Defense Counterdrug Intelligence Program) money, it is being transferred to S3's FORNSAT<br>Division for full integration into the SIGINT System's architecture and life cycle support issues.<br>(U//FOUO) Note: The above information was presented by<br>Intelligence and Technical Review.<br><br> at a recent SID<br><br>(U//FOUO) For further information on CANYONDUST, contact the following representatives:<br>. <br><br> Technical Director of the Office of International Crime and Narcotics (S2F), at<br> CANYONDUST Program Manager, <br><br>.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
