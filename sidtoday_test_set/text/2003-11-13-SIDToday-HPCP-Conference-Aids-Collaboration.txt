DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) HPCP Conference Aids Collaboration<br>FROM:<br>Deputy Chief of the MOC's SIGINT Development Division<br>Run Date: 11/13/2003<br><br>(S//SI) The Worldwide High Power Cordless Phone (HPCP) Conference, which took place from 27<br>to 31 October 2003 in the R&amp;E; Symposium, was a resounding success. The intent of the<br>conference "HPCP Challenge: Team Effort" was not to solve all the issues within a week, but to<br>create a forum for all the active participants to establish networks, collaborate, plan future<br>dialogues and reduce or eliminate duplicative efforts, so that all the right people Communitywide would be engaged in prosecuting this new technology smartly.<br>(S//SI) MG Richard Quirk opened the conference by charging the participants to view HPCP<br>exploitation as a "significant challenge, but a significant opportunity." He suggested that<br>methodologies established to exploit HPCP could be used as a template to tackle other tough<br>targets in the 21st century. Mr. Charlie Allen, Assistant DCI for Collection, then emphasized the<br>need for strong collaboration within and outside the SIGINT Community to combat this realworld threat. He stressed the need "to work as a team because our adversaries are working as<br>one," noting that "America is now in a real struggle against a small, elusive and very very<br>dangerous enemy....Being able to collect communication devices such as HPCP phones can<br>literally spell the difference between life and death...life for us, death for would-be terrorists."<br>(S//SI) The conference was sponsored by <br> Chief, SIGDEV Strategy and Governance<br>and hosted by the Meade Operations Center's HPCP Analysis Cell (HAC). Conference registration<br>exceeded 500 personnel to include representatives from all the Second Party partners, each of<br>the U.S. armed services, and numerous contractors, as well as members from across the entire<br>Intelligence Community. To accommodate the participation of over 200 personnel from outside<br>NSAW and ensure maximum participation by all, NSAW personnel were encouraged to view the<br>conference either through NewsMagazine in their offices or at designated viewing areas within<br>the MOC.<br>(S//SI) The success of the conference can be directly attributed to the hard work of the HPCP<br>Conference Committee, headed by MOC Technical Director, Mr. Phil Cartun. His goal was to<br>provide briefings on as many aspects of HPCP as possible, from collection to reverse<br>engineering. In addition, he was successful in acquiring some nontraditional briefs, such as the<br>FCC (Federal Communications Commission) briefing on the use of SENAO in the United States,<br>and the National Ground Intelligence Center's (NGIC) involvement in exploiting improvised<br>explosive devices (IEDs). As a result of the sidebar discussions, numerous issues were identified<br>for the HAC to address in the coming weeks. These issues and their status, along with copies of<br>the briefs and a list of the conference attendees, are posted on the HAC homepage or type "go<br>hac."<br>(U//FOUO) Photo (l-r):<br> (SSG Staff), MG Richard Quirk (SID Director), COL<br>Christine Marsh (MOC Commander), CW4 <br> (HAC Chief), Philip Cartun (HPCP<br>Conference Committee Chairman/MOC Technical Leader), <br> (MOC), Charlie Allen<br>(ADCI/C), SFC<br> (MOC), <br> (HPCP Project Manager)<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DERIVED FROM: 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br></p>
