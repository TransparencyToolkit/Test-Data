Below is<br>the text of this guidance from NSA's Contract Operations, Records Center and Archives, FYI:<br><br>(U) Documenting Your Contribution during the Iraqi Crisis<br>(U) From a historical perspective any support NSA provides to the Iraqi crisis is significant. All<br>efforts are important in accomplishing the NSA/CSS mission -- and all should be documented. In<br>most cases it takes only a few minutes to preserve a record of your contribution. Here are a few<br>tips on how to document your organization's role in this crisis.<br>(U) Records Management Officers (RMO) are the first line of defense for preserving all important<br>records depicting NSA's critical role in the Iraq crisis. RMOs should be able to provide advice on<br>what information must be preserved. For those especially difficult questions, the corporate<br>Records Management Program (RMP) office may be reached at<br> or via e-mail at <br>.<br>(U) Essentially, Federal Law mandates what a record is, and how (long) it should be saved.<br>However, our country is engaged in a war and NSA is playing a major role, therefore extra effort<br>should be put forth not only to ensure that all the information is preserved, but also that it is<br>complete and readily identifiable as war related for future researchers. The following are some<br>thoughts on what additional information might be saved:<br>(U) E-MAIL/ELECTRONIC BRIEFINGS (e.g., POWRPOINT): While some Agency<br>organizations have systems for preserving electronic information, yours may not. At the<br>very least, e-mails and briefings (in color) containing valuable and insightful information<br>pertaining to some facet of the war should be copied to paper, entered into the<br>organization's central filing system, and retained according to the Records Disposition<br>Schedule (RDS).<br>(U) Whether in normal operations or crises, several types of information often do not get<br>preserved; perhaps some changes should now be considered:<br>1.  (U) Verbal directions: Quick notes about directions given during informal meetings<br>or via the telephone.<br>2.  (U) The reasons for decisions: All too often, memorandums record who was at a<br>meeting and what the outcome was, but omit the reasoning behind decisions or<br>actions. Making a few comments about the reasons for a decision or activity can<br>be most helpful in both "lessons learned" studies and later historical analysis.<br>3.  (U) Short summaries (or even anecdotes) about successes and failures: These can<br>be captured in e-mail, memoranda, or other formats which are then saved and<br>filed.<br>4.  (U) Sometimes even seemingly mundane things -- such as manning schedules,<br>phone lists, SOP papers, and the like -- can be valuable later to the historian for<br>establishing identities, dates, and procedural matters.<br>(U) It is likely that senior people will be interviewed after-the-fact; however, they are not the<br>only ones making significant contributions. The names of all major players should be retained for<br>future reference. Assistance on oral history issues can be provided by the Center for Cryptologic<br>History, which can be reached by phone at<br> or via e-mail at <br> or<br>@nsa.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U) The most difficult information to obtain for cryptologic history is how product of NSA/CSS<br>was used by decision-makers and other customers. People should be encouraged to make notes<br>on any feedback received from customers, particularly telephone or personal comments that do<br>not have hard-copy follow-up. Such comments can be documented in e-mail that is later printed<br>out and filed.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
