Fortunately, we don't have to worry-- the office of SIGINT<br>Policy is here to help our operations run smoothly. The office of<br>SIGINT Policy:<br>Ensures that new SIGINT relationships, authorities, and<br>processes are supported by the necessary policy documents<br>and vetted with the key stakeholders. This creation and<br>vetting of policies can sometimes be a painstaking process,<br>but the results support SIGINT mission requirements. The<br>results also allow us to more consistently understand and<br>implement the associated processes, leading to a smoother<br>flow of operations.<br>Documents important precedents and key baselines for<br>continued forward movement. In fact, many of today's<br>policy documents are considered to be "living documents" to<br>keep pace with the SIGINT evolution.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Communications and<br>Support Operations<br>(CSO)<br>1.
