DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) General Zahner's View from the Front<br>FROM: SID Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/09/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) It was a packed house in Friedman Auditorium on Friday afternoon, 6 June 2003.<br>Employees from across the Agency filed in or tuned in to listen to Brigadier General Richard P.<br>Zahner's reflections from IRAQI FREEDOM. General Zahner took a strong, yet humble approach<br>as he discussed his accomplishments, and the impact that the NSA workforce had on the<br>successful outcome of the war in Iraq.<br>(U//FOUO) General Zahner's presentation began with expressions of gratitude as he thanked the<br>members of the workforce who continued successfully to prosecute targets across "the rest of<br>the world." He then thanked those who focused their efforts directly on CENTCOM, ultimately<br>advocating the teamwork across the Agency that was clearly visible and necessary in order to<br>make this military effort a success.<br>(TS//SI) General Zahner spoke of the importance of the coalition forces, noting that the support<br>given by the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Germany was integral to the victorious outcome.<br>His in-depth discussion of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM was coupled with an introductory analysis<br>of the differences between the campaign in Iraq and the previous campaign in Afghanistan. He<br>noted that Afghanistan represented a different perspective due to the large-scale conflict. He<br>remarked that the "Shock and Awe" campaign attributed to Iraq actually resided with the<br>conflict in Afghanistan; it was a different strategy and had different operational importance. In<br>particular, General Zahner specified the SIGINT contributions to the campaign in Afghanistan<br>that led to the distrust amongst Afghan troops, which proved immensely successful for the<br>American effort.<br>(TS//SI) General Zahner then steered his discussion specifically towards the campaign in Iraq,<br>noting the role that careful intelligence analysis played in Iraq. He spoke openly about the<br>tendency of the United States "to paint a picture of the worst nightmare." He noted that the<br>purpose was to ensure preparation for anything, but that the result was diverted attention, a<br>loss of agility, and missed opportunities caused by a flogging away at the "bad dreams." He<br>illustrated the concept of preparing for the worst as he discussed fears of being sprayed with<br>gallons of chemical weapons. Zahner noted the military complexity of the embedded members<br>of the Republican Guard, but claimed that due to the combination of efforts from the US, the<br>UK, and Australia, the obstacle was overcome. He discussed the difference in threats, specifying<br>that in Iraq, one's neighbor often represented the most significant threat.<br>(TS//SI) General Zahner spoke emphatically about the importance of taking risks. He stated,<br>"Victory does not come to the timid." He argued that we must take accurate and prudent risks,<br>for without them success will not be achieved. Furthermore, he advocated for an investment of<br>personnel and wealth, categorizing this investment as part of the risk-taking process. He<br>claimed, "If you don't take a risk, you're not going to get there!" General Zahner spent the last<br>few minutes of his presentation answering questions. Finally, he was presented with a plaque<br>from the Iraq Issue Managers Team in gratitude for his success and demonstration of excellence<br>throughout the Iraq Campaign.<br>(U//FOUO) If you missed today's presentation, or would like to hear it again, please request a<br>copy of the broadcast from <br>nsa (DL<br>from an NT).
