Your efforts have been essential to the plans of<br>the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador John D. Negroponte, as well as to<br>the United Kingdom's Permanent Representative, HMA Sir Jeremy Greenstock.<br>(S//SI) Ambassador Negroponte took time in February 2003 to provide unsolicited feedback on<br>the quality, timeliness, and quantity of NSA reporting. He said that he could not imagine better<br>intelligence support for diplomatic activity than he receives from the daily NSA reporting on Iraq<br>and the UN. He was especially grateful for the timeliness of the information and asked our<br>representative at the U.S. Mission to the UN, <br> to pass his thanks to the many people<br>involved in its production and delivery. His only complaint was that "there's just so much good<br>stuff to read and so little time to do it!" Ambassador Negroponte has been an avid user of<br>SIGINT for many years and visited NSA in February 2002, exclaiming that he has never received<br>better support in his 40-year diplomatic career. It is our hope that the Ambassador will visit NSA<br>again when the frenzy of the Iraqi crisis subsides.<br>(S//SI) For his part, Ambassador Greenstock, on the very day in February that he tabled the<br>UK-US-Spain "second resolution" on Iraq, intrigued by the close UK-US intelligence cooperation,<br>said that SIGINT insights into the nuances of internal divisions among the five permanent<br>members of the UN Security Council (the "P5") were highly useful, enabling him to decide what<br>line to take with P5 counterparts in New York and Washington and to temper the language of his<br>diplomatic forays. On 5 February, the day that Secretary of State Powell made his presentation<br>at the UN Security Council and, as a direct result of SIGINT reporting, a last-minute amendment<br>was made to the UK Foreign Secretary's speech, making the point that UNMOVIC inspections<br>had already been substantially reinforced.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
