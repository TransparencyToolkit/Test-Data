DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) MG Quirk as the SIGINT Director: We're on the Right Path<br>FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 04/21/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Replacing a legend is not easy. Maureen Baginski's remarkable accomplishments as<br>the first Signals Intelligence Director have left an indelible impact on our organization and<br>people. Our loss is the FBI's gain. As their new Executive Assistant Director for Intelligence, Mo<br>will be protecting the homeland in one of the nation's most critical positions. It is my honor to<br>follow her as the next Signals Intelligence Director for the National Security Agency. I am also<br>proud to have Charlie Meals as the new Signals Intelligence Deputy Director. Charlie and I will<br>be a true team and his wealth of SIGINT expertise will help guide our organization as we move<br>into the future.<br>(U//FOUO) During my tour here at NSA, I've learned that we have it right and that we need to<br>keep it moving in the right direction. Our superb performance supporting the warfighters and<br>policy makers in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom is clear evidence of this. Our<br>organizational structure and strategy are sound, and the changes we've implemented over<br>recent years have postured us to meet the challenges that lie ahead. We're working together<br>and meeting customer needs in ways that were inconceivable only a few years ago. A continued<br>commitment to our SID Strategy and its alignment with NSA's Corporate Strategy remains vital.<br>So my primary goal will be to keep us on the successful course set by that strategy. Some<br>adjustments may be necessary along the way. But each and every day, we'll work together to<br>build on our achievements.<br>(U//FOUO) I am also looking forward to working with those who will fill leadership positions in<br>SID's Deputy Directorates(see related<br>article in SID Today) -- as a united leadership team, committed to our strategy and cascading it<br>down into your trusted hands. To all of us, the SID workforce will be paramount--the strength of<br>our organization lies with its talented, dedicated workforce and the tremendous contributions<br>you bring to SIGINT. I'm counting on you to continue the relentless pursuit of our mission.<br>Charlie and I will make a point of interacting extensively with the workforce both here at NSAW<br>and across our vast and global extended enterprise. We'll be doing a lot of walking around-both<br>at NSAW and at our Field Sites and partners-to visit you in your workspaces. And we invite you<br>to feel free to visit us at any time.<br>(UFOUO) We're planning a SID Town Meeting in the near future to listen to your comments and<br>answer some of your questions (watch for the announcement). And the SID Mailbag is open, so<br>take advantage of it and send us your comments, concerns, and suggestions. As Charlie and I<br>settle into our new roles, we want to hear from you.<br>(U//FOUO) This is our SID and our NSA. You're the ones with the best sense of how to continue<br>our sucess. I am so proud to continue to serve with you in taking care of today's mission and<br>preparing the SIGINT Enterprise for the future.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
