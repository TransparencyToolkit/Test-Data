DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) Information Needs Management: Careful Planning Aids<br>SIGINT Response to Iraq War<br>FROM:<br>Acting Chief, Customer Gateway<br>Run Date: 04/17/2003<br>(S//SI) The months of advanced warning which we received prior<br>to the onset of war in Iraq allowed the Customer Relationships<br>Directorate (CRD) to help NSA to understand customers'<br>Information Needs (INs) like never before. The benefits both to<br>NSA and to customers are clear. Customers are confident that NSA<br>knows what information they need and that it is working to provide<br>that information. NSA, in turn, has had a reasonably stable list of<br>validated, comprehensive, coherent INs against which to focus the<br>efforts of its people and equipment.<br>(S//SI) Since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, NSA has<br>not experienced the flood of customer requests for information that<br>was feared. This is an example of planning which succeeds in a<br>time of crisis. For example, since March 17th, a few days before<br>the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, we have received only<br>29 new or modified Information Needs in the National SIGINT<br>Requirements Process (NSRP). The 24/7 watch desks, which were<br>stood up for the Campaign, proved able to manage this volume. By<br>contrast, during the first two weeks following the attacks of 11<br>September 2001, NSOC was flooded with nearly 300 requests for<br>information; and by the end of 2001, this number had skyrocketed<br>to nearly 1700.<br>(S//SI) How did this improvement come about? The success<br>resulted from a lot of hard work and determination on the part of<br>multiple elements of SID, the Extended Enterprise, and the<br>Intelligence Community. Leadership from senior SID and CRD<br>managers provided the key transformational initiative. Three<br>initiatives came together to provide for a successful outcome:<br>A group of representatives from all the intelligence<br>disciplines (SIGINT, IMINT, HUMINT, MASINT, OSINT)<br>worked for months last autumn to gather, synthesize, and<br>most importantly, map Information Needs to government<br>leadership and military commanders' key decision points.<br>The NSRP system came on-line in mid-summer and was<br>declared operational in early 2003, bringing with it the<br>Customer Information Needs Desk on the NSOC floor.<br>The CRD opened the Requirements Analysis Center (RAC) in<br>late 2002 to manage and adjust the focus of the SIGINT<br>System on the specific INs of the most interest to our<br>customers at any given moment in time.<br>(S//SI) By the end of January, the integrated list of SIGINT<br>Information Needs had been entered into NSRP. Since that time,<br>an intensive effort has continued to keep this list up-to-date and to<br>remain closely coupled with the customers' battle rhythm to ensure<br>that we are focusing on the most important needs and are<br>delivering the intelligence that counts in time to make a difference.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Customer Relations<br>1.
