DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Front Office Open House - April 23rd<br>FROM: Maureen Baginski<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 04/15/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) As I've said before, the past 2 1/2 years has been a time of<br>extraordinary success for SIGINT. The single reason for the success is all of<br>you--the incredibly talented and dedicated men and women who perform<br>miracles in defense of the nation every day. As Chris Inglis, Bill Crumm and I depart, we want to<br>somehow express our gratitude to you. We realize that nothing we do could properly<br>acknowledge the national treasure that is the SID workforce. But we are going to try anyway!<br>(U) On 23 April, from 1000-1200, we will open the SID front office (2W106), equip it with<br>goodies (that's the bribe part!), and take some time to thank all of you who are able to stop by<br>for what you have done for us personally and professionally, and of course, for what you've done<br>for the nation. We understand the demands of mission and how precious time is to each of you.<br>We hope you can find the time to visit and let us say thanks. We can't guarantee we won't run<br>out of goodies, but our supply of gratitude and respect is unlimited, whether you are able to<br>come by or not. As always, thanks for all you do. Hope to see you on the 23rd.<br>(U) Thanks.<br>Mo<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
