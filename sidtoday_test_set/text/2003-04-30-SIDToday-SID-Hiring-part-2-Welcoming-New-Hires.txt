DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Hiring (part 2: Welcoming New Hires)<br>FROM: Maria Magoulas-Perkins<br>Chief, SIGINT People Office<br>Run Date: 04/30/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) In part 1 of this message, I indicated that SID will hire over 500 people this year.<br>Please remember that it is not just the responsibility of the receiving supervisor but it is the<br>responsibility of us all to do our part to make our new hires feel welcomed and productive as<br>quickly as possible.<br>(U//FOUO) We all were new at one time and had to "learn the ropes." If we are indeed hiring the<br>most qualified applicants, then learning curves should not be overwhelming. (If we are not hiring<br>people with the requisite minimum job skills, then please advise the People Office so we can<br>help correct the problem.) Our new hires are an investment in our future. If we help them and<br>get them trained as quickly as possible despite our current workload, they will help us<br>immeasurably in the future by reducing that workload.<br>(U//FOUO) A series of on-line job aids are available to assist supervisors with a more friendly<br>and productive assimilation process. This website was developed for anyone who is responsible<br>for the in-house training and orientation of a new hire or veteran employees new to the office. It<br>can be accessed by typing 'go ojt' or by clicking here.<br>(U//FOUO) I would like to thank you all for your hard work and commitment to ensuring we get<br>the quality personnel to address our SIGINT requirements. I would like to thank you for<br>whatever part you play in making our new hires feel a welcomed, valued, and contributing<br>member of the SIGINT team.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
