DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S) NSA Implements New Policy for Sharing Data with CIA<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>SIGINT Director<br>Run Date: 07/21/2003<br><br>(S//SI) With NSA and CIA now collaborating more closely and productively than ever before, Lt<br>Gen Hayden recently put in place a new policy to define how one aspect of this relationship will<br>work. This new policy governs the provision of NSA-collected information to CIA under CIA's<br>NSCID 5 ("U.S. Espionage and Counterintelligence Activities Abroad") authorities. In 1972,<br>NSCID 5 established the authority of CIA to engage in SIGINT activities in support of its<br>clandestine espionage and counterintelligence activities (HUMINT and Covert Operations)<br>abroad. Deliberate and measured applications of this authority have been a key part of our<br>relationship with CIA and have been an important part of mission success in a number of areas.<br>(S//SI) The power and impact of SIGINT, especially as seen in the Global War on Terrorism and<br>most recently in Operation Iraqi Freedom, have increased the demand for SIGINT support to<br>these HUMINT and Covert Operations. The extent of our SIGINT System's resources and<br>capabilities makes NSA uniquely suited to collecting SIGINT on behalf of CIA. This new policy, in<br>essence, defines how we will provide NSA-collected, unminimized** SIGINT to CIA for them to<br>use in direct support of certain aspects of their mission. It also establishes clear procedures for<br>how NSA and CIA will handle NSCID 5 support interactions; NSA's focal point for these requests<br>will be the Customer Gateway organization.<br>(S//SI) We have been working with all concerned to document the policy on NSA's provision of<br>NSCID 5 SIGINT support to CIA (NSA/CSS Policy No. 2-11) and the attendant procedures<br>(USSID 180(P)) . A few key points:<br>NSA has provided--and will further provide--training, as necessary, to appropriate<br>personnel<br>CIA personnel have been briefed to ensure that those involved understand the process<br>CIA will certify each NSCID 5 SIGINT support request as being related to HUMINT/Covert<br>Operations and provide related information<br>CIA will have this traffic only for its own use (e.g., lead information) and will handle the<br>traffic in accordance with NSA classification guidelines<br>NSA will continue to do all relevant foreign intelligence analysis and reporting<br>NSA will follow normal processes with respect to CIA-requested reporting related to<br>human assets and operations<br>(S//SI) Some may question whether NSA is surrendering its SIGINT mission to another Agency-the effective application of this NSCID over the past 30 years has demonstrated that nothing<br>could be further from the truth. It is simply most efficient for NSA to use its existing accesses<br>and capabilities to collect this SIGINT on CIA's behalf and for CIA to do their own analysis in<br>support of their NSCID 5 missions. In addition, the authority to analyze and report this<br>information as foreign intelligence remains with NSA. This policy is consistent with the kind of<br>collaboration and information sharing we have leveraged to great effect in partnerships with a<br>number of other intelligence agencies.<br>(S//SI) The new USSID delineates specific procedures and responsibilities for NSCID 5 support<br>to CIA. Please familiarize yourselves with the provisions of the new policy and USSID. Questions<br>and comments should be directed to SIGINT Policy <br>), which will coordinate the<br>development of comprehensive responses and ensure that we identify and address any<br>unresolved issues.<br>** (U) "Minimization" is a specific set of procedures adopted by the Attorney General that are<br>reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular surveillance to<br>minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">information concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of the<br>United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information.
