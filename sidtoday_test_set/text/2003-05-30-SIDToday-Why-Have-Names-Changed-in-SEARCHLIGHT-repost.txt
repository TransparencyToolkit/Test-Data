DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Why Have Names Changed in SEARCHLIGHT? (repost)<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 05/30/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) You may have noticed that many names are now appearing differently in<br>SEARCHLIGHT-- often middle initials have been replaced with the person's full middle name.<br>Why is it happening, and how can you have your entry changed if it is not appearing correctly?<br>We'll get to the "why" a little later, but first the "how":<br>If your middle name now appears in full and used to be just an initial, you cannot have it<br>changed back to just the initial.<br>If an incorrect middle name is now appearing, you can have it changed by contacting<br>"ISMT" (<br>nsa or DL ISMT).<br>(U//FOUO) Now on to the "why": CONCERTO is the Agency's personnel system. Most of your<br>personnel information is in what we'll call the "HR" part of CONCERTO. This is what you, your<br>supervisor, and other authorized people see when you log into CONCERTO and look at your<br>profile. Stuff like your awards, past assignments, etc. is in there. Obviously your name and your<br>SSN are part of HR CONCERTO for identification purposes. There is also a SECURITY part of<br>CONCERTO. This is where your clearances, etc. are kept. Your name and SSN are also part of<br>SECURITY CONCERTO for identification purposes. The two parts of CONCERTO are kept separate<br>for obvious security reasons, but "Mary Jane Smith" with SSN: 123-456-7890 in HR CONCERTO<br>is the same person as "Smith,Mary Jane" with SSN: 123-456-7890 in SECURITY CONCERTO.<br>(U//FOUO) SEARCHLIGHT is the Agency's corporate directory service. The "registration" of your<br>name and SSN in SEARCHLIGHT (for those of you whose SEARCHLIGHT records are marked<br>"confirmed") originated in the HR CONCERTO. In HR CONCERTO, middle initials tend to be more<br>prevalent than middle names. So "Mary Jane Smith" may have appeared in SEARCHLIGHT as<br>"Mary J. Smith".<br>(U//FOUO) ...ENTER THE PKI CERTIFICATE:<br>(U//FOUO) A required part of creating the PKI certificate, which is used to electronically identify<br>you, is the inclusion of your full name. Because your PKI will be used for identification in<br>electronic systems and exchanges (such as e-mail), the corporate directory system,<br>SEARCHLIGHT, must now have you registered with your full name. Part of your PKI certificate<br>also includes your security credentials and the official source of this information is SECURITY<br>CONCERTO. To get your PKI certificate, your full name must be in SEARCHLIGHT and must<br>match your full name in SECURITY CONCERTO. So, in order to get a PKI certificate, "Mary J.<br>Smith" in SEARCHLIGHT must be changed to "Mary Jane Smith." In addition, for those people<br>who did not already have a PKI certificate by March 2003, it is important to know that the name<br>change has already occurred in SEARCHLIGHT. For those who already had a PKI certificate at<br>that time, the name change has been delayed until it is time to renew the PKI certificate. When<br>those people renew their PKI certificate, a process will be triggered to automatically change their<br>SEARCHLIGHT name to match their SECURITY CONCERTO name. If there are any differences<br>between the way names are stored in SEARCHLIGHT and HR CONCERTO, those differences will<br>have to be resolved by contacting Security Information, Q235 with an email to "ISMT" (as noted<br>above).<br>(U//FOUO) NAME DIFFERENCES IN PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CERTIFICATES:<br>(U//FOUO) Many of you who have previously received your PKI certificates, did so with your<br>name in SEARCHLIGHT at a time, and in a format, which preceded the "rollover" of names from<br>SECURITY CONCERTO. If they were different, that immediately created a mismatch between the<br>PKI and SEARCHLIGHT names, which equated to an identity failure and a subsequent PKI<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">certificate revocation. However, prior discussions recognized this problem and the subsequent<br>impracticality of multiple revocations throughout the agency. It was consequently decided that<br>existing, valid PKI certificates which would encounter this condition would not be revoked, but<br>rather allowed to continue existing until their normal expiration date. The requirement for full<br>identity validation would then occur at renewal time, ultimately bringing everything in line and<br>eliminating the need for numerous immediate reapplications in the meantime.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information, see an announcement in What's New in SEARCHLIGHT .<br>Contributors to article: <br> CRD Communications <br>, Concerto Representative <br>, Searchlight Representative <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
