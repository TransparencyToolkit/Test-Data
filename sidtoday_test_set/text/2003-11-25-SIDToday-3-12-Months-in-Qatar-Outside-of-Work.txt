DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) 3 1/2 Months in Qatar: Outside of Work<br>FROM:<br>IA Intern<br>Run Date: 11/25/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) In yesterday's SID today article, I wrote about my work<br>responsibilities as an NSA analyst at CENTCOM Forward<br>Headquarters (CFH) at As Saliyah, Qatar. Today I'd like to discuss<br>some of my external activities. On average, I worked 12 hours a<br>day, 7 days a week, for nearly 3 Â½ months. As you can imagine,<br>the opportunities for external fun were few and far between.<br>(U//FOUO) After working 12+ hours per day, the easiest and<br>perhaps most frequent destination was the on-base bar (The<br>Oasis). At the time, two drinks were the maximum (thanks to<br>rowdier crowds from the past), and a movie on the "big" screen<br>constituted the entertainment.<br> <br>With my CSG colleagues earlier this year.<br>(U//FOUO) Life at As Saliyah was primitive in some respects, highly<br>advanced in others. For all but two weeks, I lived in a tent inside a<br>warehouse with about 80 other people. When compared to<br>conditions elsewhere in the AOR (Area of Responsibility), my<br>accommodations were the equivalent of the Ritz-Carlton. My<br>commute to work each day took 5-10 minutes via bicycle, and I<br>have to admit that riding through the dust storms of February and<br>March was a bit surreal.<br>The surroundings at As Saliyah.<br><br> <br><br>(U//FOUO) In the first weeks after arrival in Qatar, the dust storms<br>stand out as the most notable. Tiny dust particles found their way<br>into everything - eyes, noses, clothes - and everyone seemed to<br>have a persistent cough as a result. Newcomers to As Saliyah<br>stood out because their incessant cough would keep half the tent<br>awake until they adjusted. Located so close to the Persian Gulf,<br>humidity was nearly intolerable at times, and got worse in April and<br>May. By my recollection, the temperature soared to 120 degrees<br>on the day I returned back to the states.<br>(U//FOUO) Food service was - well, I won't lie to you - incredible.<br>Some of the dishes were repeated often, but never once did I eat<br>an MRE (Meal Ready-to-Eat). Every meal was a hot meal. Each<br>week, a surf and turf meal was served (and yet somehow we<br>survived!).<br>(U//FOUO) Newspapers were hard to come by, and since my tent<br>did not have a television, news was a hot commodity in the first<br>few weeks. One of the local workers kindly agreed to deliver a copy<br>of the Gulf Times to my bunk bed for $1 per day. I also tuned in a<br>short-wave radio to get the latest news.<br>(U//FOUO) Protective measures at As Saliyah began in earnest<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.

New concrete and sandbag bunkers<br>were constructed, and chemical and biological attack drills occurred<br>every two weeks. Just prior to the outset of OIF, personnel were<br>required to carry their protective masks at all times, and full<br>protective suits had to be kept within a few minutes' reach.<br>(U//FOUO) Once we were finally allowed off base in late April, a<br>favorite destination was "Shwarma Alley," a short stretch of road in<br>Doha where small eateries specialized in inexpensive Middle<br>Eastern food and frozen juice drinks.<br> <br>Posing with the owner of one of the restaurants<br>(U//FOUO) Later in May, I visited the gold market and a few carpet<br>shops around Doha.
