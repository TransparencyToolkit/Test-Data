DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Review: New SIGINT Requirements Course<br>FROM: Jim Cusick<br>Assistant Deputy Director for Data Acquisition<br>Run Date: 09/23/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) If you are anything like me and you kind of enjoy straying from the path of political<br>correctness, you have probably had a snoot-full of requirements and the requirements process,<br>and you may have secretly harbored the notion that ignoring the topic might make it go away.<br>Since this is billed as a review of the new SIGINT requirements course and its unlikely that they<br>would publish a review panning the course, you are probably expecting me to tell you the course<br>is better than whatever your favorite pastime may be. It ain't gonna happen.<br>(U//FOUO) The topic is just not a lot of fun. If, on the other hand, we are to have any hope of<br>dealing with the challenges of the future and if you want to make sure the "solutions" of the<br>future make it easier to do our job and produce SIGINT that matters, it is important for each and<br>every one of us to understand and master the essentials of the operational requirements<br>process. The course will not keep you on the edge of your seat, but it conveys the essential<br>information you need to make the process work for you in a painless, well taught package.<br>Worth at least twice the money I invested in it.<br>(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: Below you will find a description of the SIGINT<br>Operational Requirements and Capabilities Executive Overview (RESM 5470) course reviewed<br>above by Mr. Cusick. In addition, be aware that a more in-depth three-day version of the course<br>(RESM 2470) is available for non-executives.<br>(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Operational Requirements and Capabilities Executive Overview was<br>developed as a four-hour course in a workshop format. It is designed to assist senior and middle<br>level leaders to understand the SIGINT Operational Requirements and Capabilities approach and<br>how it contributes to identifying, analyzing, and developing both non-materiel and materiel<br>solutions to the major operational, technology and systems challenges facing the Agency. It<br>emphasizes the need to recognize and deal with the gaps between today's SIGINT architecture<br>and the Agency's future needs.<br>(U//FOUO) The course provides an opportunity for the participants to interact with their peers on<br>issues related to improving the relationship among the Requirements, Acquisition, and Financial<br>processes. It also shows how the Requirements and Capabilities process is intended to drive<br>acquisition and budget in order to develop, demonstrate, and succesfully deploy usable<br>operational capabilities and services quickly. The course has two offerings in September and is<br>planned to be presented at least four times next quarter (October through December).
