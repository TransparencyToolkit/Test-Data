NSA's 2003 campaign raised the single largest amount for the Central Maryland<br>campaign, contributing a total of $1,593,610.20. SID employees gave $690,950.56 -- that's<br>$100,000 more than in 2002!<br>(U) As the SID Senior Keyworker for the 2003 Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), I'd like to<br>express my thanks again to everyone who supported this year's campaign -- those who<br>participated in CFC events, those who made donations, and keyworkers, canvassers and<br>coordinators throughout the entire SIGINT Directorate that made it all happen. Many, many<br>causes will benefit from your generosity, and your gift will make a positive difference.
