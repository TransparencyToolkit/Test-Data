DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) The Bald Truth: The Sweet Conspiracy<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 11/14/2003<br><br>(U) One of my leadership tenets is: Excellence is<br>having a stake in someone else's success . I<br>contend that you are never excellent if you merely<br>perfect your area of responsibility. It is not until you reach out to<br>make sure the next guy looks good that you break into the band of<br>excellence. I even ask my subordinates to specifically target<br>someone for success and take him or her on as a personal project.<br>This takes the whole thing to a practical level. I have seen people<br>competing with one another as to who can make who look better.<br>It is a powerful positive cycle. It makes people work for something<br>other than themselves and is generally healthier in the end.<br>(U) But I today want to talk about targeting your boss for success.<br>Yes, that's right, your boss. Unfortunately, our cynical nature has<br>branded working hard for the boss as automatically some kind of<br>sycophantic, self-promoting evil. While every organization has its<br>share of suck-ups, we really need to allow the boss some<br>prerogatives to chart the future, and accept our responsibility to<br>work hard to achieve that vision. Let's develop a sweet conspiracy<br>to make the boss (and the organization) look good. This will be<br>more important as you mature and you are able to see the boss's<br>shortcomings. It is always a shock when you finally figure out the<br>boss is human and trying hard to make up for his weaknesses sometimes by covering them up, sometimes with a bit of bluster<br>and sometimes with denial. A good subordinate should conspire to<br>fill the gaps. In my case it takes a village to get together and cover<br>my personal weaknesses (ask my front office!), but there is<br>nothing wrong with getting the gang together and figuring out how<br>to support the boss. Give it a try.<br><br> SERIES: <br>The Bald Truth<br>1.  The Bald Truth:<br>Technical Leadership<br>2.  The Bald Truth: The<br>Sweet Conspiracy<br>3.

Letters to the Editor:<br>Helping Your Leaders<br>Make Decisions that<br>Stick<br>6.  Letter to the Editor:<br>Helping Your Leaders<br>Make Decisions that<br>Stick<br><br>(U) On a personal level, consider this: how about making your<br>competition look good? Yeah, I know that next promotion will<br>either go to you or that other guy. Can you rise above the peer-topeer competition to unselfishly help the other guy? This is probably<br>a radical idea but let me tell you, people like me in leadership<br>positions do this and look for it in junior people as a sign of 'getting<br>it'. I am in the business of evaluating and judging people - trying to<br>figure out their potential. When I see the signs of excellence<br>displayed in a dedication to someone else's success I really take<br>note. In the end you must strive for significance instead of just<br>success . Your pay grade may indicate success, but the people<br>you have helped along the way measure significance. Are you a<br>significant person?
