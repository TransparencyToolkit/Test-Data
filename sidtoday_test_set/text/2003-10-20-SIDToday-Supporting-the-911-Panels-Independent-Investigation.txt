DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Supporting the 9/11 Panel's Independent Investigation<br>FROM: The SID 9/11 Response Team (a.k.a. the MAG)<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 10/20/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) You may remember from DIRgram-286 that another investigation into the events of<br>9/11 is gaining momentum as we speak. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the<br>United States (also known as the Kean Commission, or the Independent Commission) is<br>gathering information from the Federal Government, State and local governments and the<br>private sector to document the definitive history of the events of 9/11 and to examine systemic<br>issues that may be corrected to prevent future attacks. So, how does SID fit into this<br>investigation? Here is some information to bring you up to date!<br>(U//FOUO) First, let us introduce ourselves. We are the SID 9/11 Response Team -- a four<br>member team on SID Staff, dedicated exclusively to supporting the National Commission's<br>investigation. Also known as the MAG, the team was put into place during the House and Senate<br>Intelligence Committees' Joint Inquiry into 9/11. Our membership has changed since the Joint<br>Inquiry, but the team's mission remains the same -- to pinpoint the information the National<br>Commission requests from SID and provide it promptly and effectively, ensuring candor,<br>completeness and correctness. Working closely with NSA's Office of General Counsel (the Agency<br>lead), we anticipate the National Commission's interests or concerns and alert folks in SID to<br>information they may be asked to provide. So, if you hear from our team, you'll know why! As<br>the Director made clear in DIRgram-286 , NSA is providing the same level of full support to the<br>National Commission's investigation that it provided to the Joint Inquiry.<br>(S//SI) As far as the investigation goes, SID has responded to several National Commission<br>requests by providing large volumes of SIGINT assessment reporting on terrorism, strategic<br>business plans, analytic demonstrations, explanations of SID's analytic strategy and the SIGINT<br>Requirements process, as well as briefings from the Counterterrorism, Regional Targets, Middle<br>East and North Africa, and Geospatial Exploitation product lines. With few exceptions, National<br>Commission staffers are not SIGINTers by trade. So, all of these briefings and discussions have<br>given them valuable insight into our business and an appreciation for the complexities of our<br>work! While at NSA, staff members have also had the benefit of seeing time-sensitive operations<br>at the NSOC and the Meade Operations Center first-hand.<br>(U//FOUO) The National Commission is now moving into the next phase of its investigation and<br>is preparing to interview SID personnel. Chances are you will not be one of the few SID<br>personnel interviewed. However, if you are, we will work with you and with the Office of General<br>Counsel to give you background information on the investigation and share the Commission's<br>perspectives, so that you are prepared and the interviews are as productive and informative for<br>the Commission staffers as possible.<br>(U//FOUO) So far, National Commission staff members have been favorably impressed with<br>SID's technical and analytic expertise, as well as its extraordinary level of cooperation. This is<br>not surprising! The Director has told us to be forthcoming during this investigation and both MG<br>Quirk and Mr. Meals have expressed strong support for SID's interactions with the Commission.<br>We also have an obligation to our nation. As the investigation progresses, we look forward to<br>seeing more examples of the outstanding response the SID workforce has shown to date.
