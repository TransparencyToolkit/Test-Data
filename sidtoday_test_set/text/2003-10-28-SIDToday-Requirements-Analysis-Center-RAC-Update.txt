DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Requirements Analysis Center (RAC) Update<br>FROM:<br>Deputy Chief, Requirements Analysis Center<br>Run Date: 10/28/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) The Customer Relationships Directorate's Requirements Analysis Center (RAC), S16,<br>has progressed substantially since we last reported its establishment this past February. It has<br>developed analytic methodologies and processes to underpin its mission and has begun creating<br>products and services that convey the meaning of customer information needs and NSA's ability<br>to meet them.<br>(S) The RAC is now growing into two divisions - one aimed at analyzing customer needs and the<br>other at assessing NSA's effectiveness in responding to them. The work of the first division has<br>grown out of the work done for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and subsequent lessons learned.<br>In continued support to this mission, the RAC provides a customer information web page<br>(updated daily) that conveys the customer needs through themes that resonate with analysts. It<br>identifies on a weekly - or as needed - basis customer "Key Reads" that establish what issues<br>are a top priority at the present time. It identifies and coordinates "Core Needs" which are<br>strategic, enduring topics of emphasis that can provide a context for NSA support both to<br>customers and among SIGINT producers. These services provide analysts different perspectives<br>into customer needs, keeping them abreast of the fluid situation in Iraq and providing them<br>insights into the customer's decision space in order that they can optimally focus their<br>production efforts.<br>(S) As a result of this work, the RAC is now partnering with the Customer Relationships<br>Directorate's Customer Gateway office and SIGINT Planning's Operation, Research, Modeling and<br>Simulation office to quickly develop a capability that will enable the automatic generation of<br>information needs web pages and reports for all Issue Management Teams (IMTs), thus changing<br>a manually intensive operation into a greatly expanded, technologically-driven capability. This<br>new capability will also satisfy the first of SID's six operating principles - "Determine Information<br>Needs" - by enabling RAC analysts to identify and track relevant information needs in support of<br>the IMTs and Product Lines. We also see this capability as the genesis for an end-to-end SIGINT<br>thread from Customer Information Need through the entire SIGINT production cycle to the<br>delivery of information.<br>(U//FOUO) In many ways, pursuing the meaning of INs and customer requirements is like<br>studying a target - learning what baseline activity resembles and detecting significant changes.<br>Our customers have submitted literally thousands of questions through the National SIGINT<br>Requirements Process (NSRP), and we now have an additional challenge of assessing these<br>questions and producing RAC reports that convey their meaning and impact on the SIGINT<br>system. This past July, the RAC began issuing reports examining customer needs in specific<br>areas . Once the RAC is fully staffed, it will routinely analyze and report needs against key<br>customer interest areas. Most significantly, the RAC will be able to identify gaps, either in needs<br>that the customers did not submit officially, or in SID's ability to respond to them - data that can<br>feed into SID's decision cycle as it adjusts resources in concert with customer requirements.<br>(S) The Center's second division is charged with what has traditionally been a tough nut to<br>crack: evaluating NSA's effectiveness in responding to customer information needs. This means<br>getting beyond counting beans to a methodology that will assess the value of our products and<br>services. The RAC undertook its initial research and testing in this arena against a few key issues<br>that arose during the first three phases of the Iraq Campaign. The RAC first did an independent<br>evaluation and then worked with production offices and the GRSOC to ensure it captured all<br>relevant products and services. The RAC is now coordinating this evaluation with those who have<br>the only vote and final say - the customers. The assessment report is posted on WebWorld and<br>also on Intelink (for customer coordination).<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">(U//FOUO) MG Quirk recently praised the RAC and its efforts and noted to the Executive<br>Leadership Board that the RAC must be a top priority organization to fully resource. Essentially,<br>that is what the RAC's foremost mission is at the moment - finding a few more good analysts to<br>join its ranks! It is an excellent organization to broaden one's horizons through a number of<br>means: a better understanding of NSA's customers and their information needs, a deeper<br>understanding of how NSA engages its various customer sets and uses this information to<br>engage the rest of the enterprise, an in-depth look at how SID's directorates partner to respond<br>to customer requests, and a close relationship with the IMTs as this fairly new leadership role<br>progresses.
