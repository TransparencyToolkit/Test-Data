DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Introduction to <br><br>, Customer Relationships Director<br><br>FROM:<br>Deputy Director for Customer Relationships<br>Run Date: 08/01/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) It's a great time to work in the Signals Intelligence<br>Directorate (SID). First of all, it's an opportunity to improve and<br>refine the new processes that have been put into place. Secondly,<br>it's a time to feel a sense of pride for the successes you've<br>achieved in providing tremendous support to our customers over<br>the past couple of years, although I realize you may find it difficult<br>to pause and savor success in light of the continuing high ops<br>tempo. I'm very honored to have been asked to lead Customer<br>Relationships Directorate (CRD), and I am looking forward to<br>working with my colleagues to build upon these successes.<br>(U//FOUO) I've spent much of my career working directly for<br>customers and with overseers -- in a Cryptologic Service Group<br>(CSG), as an NSA representative, on the staff of a customer<br>organization, in the Legislative Affairs Office, and recently with the<br>DoD and IC requirements boards and acquisition oversight<br>authorities. I've seen firsthand not only the value of building good<br>relationships but also the importance of providing products and<br>services to customers that meet their specific needs. NSA and SID<br>have made a strong commitment to customer service by investing<br>resources to better understand the intelligence needs of our<br>customers; to improve synchronization of activities across SID and<br>focus on hunting key information; and to use those customer<br>vectors to drive our investment, business, and, often, policy<br>decisions. While the new structures and processes within CRD to<br>help SID accomplish these objectives are still very immature, we<br>are getting better. More importantly, we are receiving positive<br>feedback from customers on this business model. We will continue<br>to develop, fine tune, and strengthen our efforts.<br>(U//FOUO) What's the role of leadership? Having a unified vision<br>and communicating it clearly is first and foremost. Aligning goals<br>and objectives, obtaining and allocating resources (corporately not<br>competitively), empowering people to fully use their skills and<br>talents, delegating responsibility, deciding how much risk is<br>acceptable, anticipating issues and problems so as to avoid some of<br>the speed bumps, and implementing good business processes are<br>also essential. During the past nine months, I participated in the<br>Foreign Service Institute Senior Seminar sponsored by the<br>Department of State. I had the opportunity to meet and discuss<br>issues with the most senior leaders in government, military,<br>education, religion, and industry. As we met with each person and<br>learned about their strategic goals and challenges, we also asked<br>about their philosophy of leadership and how to achieve<br>organizational success. Almost without exception, each one<br>mentioned the importance of integrity to success, both personal<br>and institutional. By institutional integrity, they meant<br>transparency and openness, honesty, professional respect, follow<br>through on commitments, and cooperation.<br>(U//FOUO) Each directorate has a unique role to play, but we are<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Getting to Know the<br>SID Leadership Team<br>1.
