They will discuss how they supported the military during<br>wartime conditions, and also make some observations about the<br>exotic places they have seen.<br>(U//FOUO) By way of background, here is some information<br>(courtesy of the IA Skill Community) describing what the IA Intern<br>Program is all about:<br>(U//FOUO) The IA Intern/Cross-Training/MINSAP** Program,<br>which has grown to over 200 participants, is designed to give<br>analysts the IA skills and knowledge they need to fill our most<br>critical SIGINT and Information Assurance mission gaps. It is<br>expected that this program will develop well-trained junior analysts<br>who possess both depth and breadth in a certain area of mission<br>expertise and who, upon completion of the program, can "hit the<br>ground running."<br>(U//FOUO) The developmental program lasts three years, and<br>includes both rotational assignments and formal training. The<br>participants usually have six rotational assigments which generally<br>last 6 months, but can range from 3 to 9 months depending on the<br>complexity of the subject area or goals of the particular tour. The<br>rotational assigments include on-the-job training in the areas of<br>research, reporting, and SIGINT Development at NSA HQ. Other<br>possibilities include an external assigment with a downtown<br>customer, a NIST assigment or a tour at F6 . At the completion of<br>the program, the participant will be placed in a final assignment<br>selected to match their experience/educational background with<br>mission needs.<br>**MINSAP=Military Intern SIGINT Analyst Program<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.
