Last year, the State Department submitted an<br>Intelligence Need for SIGINT on the leader of the Russian Tambov crime syndicate, a Mr.<br>Kumarin. (State wanted to learn whether there were any links between the St. Petersburg<br>syndicate and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg in<br>the mid 1990's.) To produce SIGINT on this topic, SID analysts had their work cut out for them-NSA had neither Mr. Kumarin's phone number nor a sample of his voice.<br>(TS//SI) Many months of target development, however, have led to success: the Office of Crime<br>and Narcotics (OCN) is now issuing SIGINT reports based on intercept of Kumarin's telephone.<br>The identification and collection of Kumarin's phone number was made possible by the efforts of<br>OCN's <br> who worked with Math Research Group analysts to produce contact<br>chaining charts and collection managers to optimize collection. This task could be accomplished<br>only through the coordinated efforts of various SIGINT disciplines. By taking this corporate<br>approach, we not only acquired Kumarin's phone number, but also gained more insights into his<br>organization and activities.<br>(S) If you'd like additional information about this story, please contact<br>Chief of the Transnational Organized Crime Branch, <br> or <br>.<br><br>, Analyst, <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br>,<br><br> </p>
