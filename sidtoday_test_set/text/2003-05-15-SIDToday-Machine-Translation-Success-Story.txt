Last fall, a representative of our own Senior Language Authority (SLA) learned<br>that the CIA had obtained the latest and best Arabic machine translation software, produced<br>under a 7-year long development contract with a foreign firm. However, such software usually<br>needed to go through a costly and time-consuming code review process before it could be used.<br>The SLA representative pointed out that NSA's Information Assurance (IA) Research Group had<br>developed a capability that makes foreign software safe-and thus could provide a way for NSA to<br>host CIA's new Arabic machine translation securely and quickly.<br>(S//SI) Our SLA representative then partnered with the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI)<br>Foreign Language Committee and the Technical Manager of Language and Speech Exploitation<br>Resources at Ft. Huachuca to identify funding to implement the plan. The NSA Center for Applied<br>Machine Translation (CAMT) worked through the Chief Information Officer and the Research<br>Directorate to create a special turn key secure environment to host the necessary applications,<br>and the new secure environment was approved in mid-March.<br>(S//SI) The result? NSAnet was able to host CIA's latest Arabic machine translation just as the<br>Middle East situation escalated into war. In March, for example, 11,000+ documents were<br>translated through the CAMT, as compared to the usual 3,000. Users included the USS Carl<br>Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, the USS Mount Whitney, and many other military intelligence<br>units deployed in the Gulf.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information, contact<br> Senior Language Technical<br>Authority; Chairman, LASER ACTD Text Integrated Product Team, <br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
