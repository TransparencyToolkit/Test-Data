DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S) North Korea MULTI-INT Process<br>FROM:<br>Customer Gateway (S11)<br>Run Date: 10/09/2003<br><br>(S) SID has developed a variety of processes to improve our understanding of what our<br>customers need from us - from the new National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP), to<br>feedback from NSA people integrated with our customers, to Senior Executive Account Managers<br>(SEAMs) and Account Managers (AMs), to emails, phone calls and VTCs between analysts,<br>managers and customers. But there's still no substitute for personally meeting with customer<br>analysts and the decision-makers they support to understand the challenges they face and<br>exactly what they'll need from intelligence to support their planning, decisions, and actions.<br>That's why SID is committed to the multi-intelligence (MULTI-INT) requirements gathering<br>process, which involves direct face-to-face meetings with analysts and decisions-makers to<br>understand their goals, objectives, and plans. The MULTI-INT process was first used successfully<br>for the U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) SIGINT Architecture and Operation Iraqi<br>Freedom, and we're now in the process of using it to support North Korea Campaign planning.<br>(S) The MULTI-INT process begins by identifying those customers who have key operational<br>roles in support of U.S. Government objectives. In the case of the Campaign to stop North<br>Korea's development and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), we determined<br>that State Department, the U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), and U.S. Forces Korea (USFK)<br>had the lead for operational planning. Meetings with State Department were first with members<br>of both the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) Gateway organization (S11) and<br>OPSIGINT conducting a series of meeting to understand State Department's planning for North<br>Korea.<br>(S) These reviews have garnered very positive reactions from State Department leadership to<br>include the Secretary's Chief of Staff, and senior analysts and policy advisors on East Asia Pacific<br>Affairs who participated directly in the meetings. We followed that up with meetings with<br>USPACOM and USFK senior officials who were directly involved in crafting the operational plans<br>for the Commander of USPACOM. Although we are still in the very early stages of planning and<br>all plans are subject to frequent revisions, we now have a better understanding of needed<br>adjustments to formal requirements and where the Korea Issue Management Team (IMT) needs<br>to focus its attention.<br>(S) We call this process the MULTI-INT process because we and other Intelligence Community<br>(IC) members recognized that this process was useful for all intelligence disciplines and not just<br>SIGINT. While the IC has been happy that NSA is taking the lead on this planning, they want to<br>participate in the effort as well. As such, we are working with DIA, CIA, and other IC partners to<br>form a common understanding of the intelligence requirements for North Korea and to avoid<br>conflicting understanding of priorities. We'll continue to work with our IC partners to make the<br>MULTI-INT process a regular part of IC planning and prioritizing.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
