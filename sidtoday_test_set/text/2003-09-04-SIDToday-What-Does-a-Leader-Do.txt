DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) What Does a Leader Do?<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 09/04/2003<br><br>(U) So far in this series, I have suggested that<br>people are good and that leadership makes a<br>difference. From the feedback I have received, I<br>say that these ideas are not universally held - but getting us<br>talking about this is really what we are after. Discuss these<br>premises with your office mates and see what you think. Keep the<br>cards and letters coming or join my brown bag lunches where we<br>can discuss them in a group session.<br>(U) Meanwhile, let's talk about what a leader does:<br>(U//FOUO) A Leader is Prepared . Let's face it: this is a technical<br>agency with technical people. A leader must be technically savvy<br>and up-to-date on our business. You are not going to succeed as a<br>leader unless you are an expert in your field. Know the mission and<br>know the technical underpinnings of it. Get out and make your<br>bones. If this means taking a job that is 'lower' than the one you<br>have now, take it. If it means going to night school, do it. NSA is a<br>winner because of expert people who know what they are doing our successes look like miracles to our customers, but we know it<br>was not hardware or software but human brainpower ('wetware')<br>that made it happen. Yes, I know the OPM competencies don't<br>include technical expertise on the senior P3's but don't fool yourself<br>- it doesn't list future potential either, but that figures in every<br>promotion authority's judgment. Become an expert manager as<br>well. Learn the resource game, get some experience in finance and<br>the other enabling areas. Your ability to use mission-based,<br>technical judgment in resource decisions will make or break you as<br>a leader here at NSA.<br>(U) A Leader Develops Other Leaders . Guess what? The main job<br>of the leader is actually not getting the mission done. Your people<br>will do that. Your main job is developing the next generation and<br>finding the ones who will take your job someday. This means you<br>will have to make the organization suffer a bit to make sure<br>talented, high potential people get leadership training and<br>developmental jobs. This is an investment, not a cost. An important<br>job for leaders in this regard is talent spotting. The truth is,<br>everyone is not equal (yikes!). A leader must make a judgment<br>about people and take action to accelerate the careers of those who<br>show promise. This is not cronyism or illegal discrimination; it is a<br>duty. Find, identify and develop the best people - they are the next<br>generation.<br>(U) A Leader is a Servant . Speaking of the generations, we have<br>more than one in the workplace today (perhaps as many as four!).<br>We have a unique challenge to transfer the experience and<br>knowledge of the baby boomers to the Gen X and Gen Y folks we<br>have been hiring. A leader seeks to understand the generations<br>and facilitate the knowledge transfer. The younger generation will<br>challenge us old fogies in this transfer. They are not employees -<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Charles Berlin<br>Discusses Leadership<br>1.  Leadership: Your<br>View of People<br>2.  Leaders Really Do<br>Make a Difference<br>3.  What Does a Leader<br>Do?<br>4.  Are Leaders Made or<br>Born?<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">they consider themselves "consumers of management services".<br>The role of a leader will change as a true collaborative environment<br>emerges. "Your people" will be working on someone else's project<br>even as they sit in "your spaces". The leader's role may shift to<br>more of a talent scout and talent agent for the individual employee<br>rather than the director of work. So individual and team<br>development is the focus. In the hierarchical model, the middle<br>manager had a primary role of conveying information up and down<br>the chain. In a transparent network, the information passes itself.<br>The leader now must focus on delivery of services to the workforce<br>(resources, tools, training, etc). Your value-added will rest not with<br>your position but your ability to deliver. Day to day, the leader<br>becomes a linchpin servant, serving the boss and the employee.<br>Are you ready?<br>(U) A Leader Cares . You have to know your people and care for<br>them. These are actually people, not machines. When I took over<br>the job I am in now, I went around and interviewed each person to<br>get to know them. I asked about their history and their future. I<br>also asked some personal questions about family, home and the<br>commute. A few employees wondered if I had any legal right to<br>ask those questions! I said I had no right but that I cared about the<br>answers. None chose not to answer. I found richness in their lives<br>and it helps me every day to remember they are not "assets",<br>"workforce", "annuitants", "char force" or "cost centers". They are<br>great Americans with hopes and dreams for themselves, their<br>families and their country. They are worthy of a leader's care. You<br>are expected to expend effort on these people's behalf. You cannot<br>care from a distance or at a theoretical level. You actually have to<br>do something. What have you done lately?<br>(U) Care for the mission too. Sometimes I think we are trying to<br>wash passion out of our culture. Lots of cold hard statistics and<br>metrics to light the way. I don't want you to let the metrics tell<br>you things aren't going to work, I want you to declare emphatically<br>that you will make it work with all the heart you have. Don't let the<br>future happen to you - make the future happen. It takes a bit of<br>passion for a leader to succeed. Do you have the strength of spirit<br>to lead?<br>(U) A Leader Communicates . Here's some news: passion for the<br>mission and caring for the people can actually be communicated.<br>It's catchy, it's infectious. It shouldn't be a secret! A major<br>component in keeping hope alive is a healthy conversation with<br>your people. In this conversation, a leader communicates values expectations of behavior and outcomes. A leader describes the<br>culture and atmosphere of the organization. Communication is not<br>just in words but action. A leader communicates values by<br>example. Every word and act is a communication. What do you<br>have to say?<br>(U) Like I said, keep the cards and letters coming.
