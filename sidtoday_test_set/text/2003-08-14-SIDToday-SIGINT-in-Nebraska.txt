DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SIGINT in Nebraska<br>FROM:<br>NSA/CSS STRATCOM<br>Run Date: 08/14/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Regards from the Heartland of America...Offutt AFB, Nebraska! Here near Omaha,<br>SIGINT has played an important role in supporting three generations of the Strategic Command:<br>the Strategic Air Command from the early 1960s through 1992; the United States Strategic<br>Command (USSTRATCOM) from 1992 to 2002; and the new USSTRATCOM-- created by merging<br>with the former United States Space Command-- from 2002 to present. (See related story HERE<br>).<br>(S//SI) When the two commands merged in October 2002, SID and NSA/CSS STRATCOM<br>quickly adapted to the expanded mission set of the new USSTRATCOM. SID now provides the<br>command with intelligence on space control and surveillance operations, information operations,<br>computer network operations, and space campaign planning, (See story HERE for further<br>information.)<br>(S//SI) In tackling these new missions, STRATCOM plays a role in areas that once would have<br>been considered unfamiliar terrain, such as the Global War on Terrorism. NSA/CSS<br>representatives at STRATCOM worked with the 55th Wing and 755th Communications Squadron<br>at Offutt AFB to turn one of their HF out-stations at Scribner, Nebraska into a radio frequency<br>test range, which most recently was used during Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (the campaign<br>in Afghanistan). Prior to OEF, the range was used to test non-conventional, airborne, and<br>ground-based collection against cordless, cell, and satellite phones used by known terrorist<br>groups. As a direct result of this test, airborne collectors sent to the Middle East were able to<br>identify previously unidentified push-to-talk systems used by terrorists.<br>(TS//SI) Meanwhile, SID continues to play an important role in STRATCOM's more traditional<br>missions, such as efforts to account for Strategic Relocatable Targets (SRT) in Russia, China,<br>and other nations with developing assets. For example, SID supported USSTRATCOM during the<br>latest "show of force" demonstrations by Russian Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) units.<br>SID/Strategic Rocket Forces provided timely SIGINT to USSTRATCOM imagery analysts, helping<br>them confirm many SS-25 (Sickle) Road Mobile ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile)<br>deployments during the SRF's winter training cycle that ended in May 2003.<br>(U//FOUO) Check out the NSA STRATCOM Homepage and the NSA STRATCOM monthly<br>newsletter, the "Heartland Herald" for more information on how SIGINT supports STRATCOM.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
