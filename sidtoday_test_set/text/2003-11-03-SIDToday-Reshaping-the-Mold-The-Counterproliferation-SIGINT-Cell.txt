The Cell is<br>composed of CIA officers and NSA analysts cross-trained on the other Agency's policies,<br>systems, and tools and with full access to the data of both agencies from CIA spaces.<br>(S//SI) Yes, that's right, we'll be doing SIGINT from the CIA. Toiling in the basement of CIA<br>Headquarters, we'll be correlating what we see and task on the SIGINT side with what the CIA's<br>Directorate of Operations is working on from the HUMINT side. This lead-sharing effort focuses<br>on the exploitation of a high-priority non-state nuclear proliferation network led by A.Q. Khan, a<br>network that cut its teeth by supplying the Pakistani nuclear program.<br>(S//SI) The Cell will also become the center for NSA analysis and reporting on the IAEA<br>(International Atomic Energy Agency) and the OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of<br>Chemical Weapons). This portion of the mission will consolidate and provide a cohesive focus to<br>reporting on international organizations key to counterproliferation which are currently either<br>under-reported, or reported in ad hoc fashion by more than a dozen separate A&amp;P; elements.<br>(S//SI) So who are the intrepid souls (or merely foolish mortals?) who dare to take this first<br>step into the swamp of information sharing? Insert your favorite literary or allegorical story<br>here, but this six-person team includes two former Russian linguists, analysts who've worked for<br>DIA and NIMA, been assigned to the Defense HUMINT Service, NSOC and KRSOC, and have<br>expertise on SIGDEV and SIGINT reporting, chemical weapons and the OPCW, the proliferation<br>target in general and the A.Q. Khan network in particular.<br>(U//FOUO) Now, immunized with the protective shield of USSID 18 briefings, having upgraded<br>their skill levels, armed with many new weapons and tools, and poised in front of multiple<br>computer systems, our troupe is ready to begin their mission and reshape the way the SIGINT<br>and HUMINT system interact to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
