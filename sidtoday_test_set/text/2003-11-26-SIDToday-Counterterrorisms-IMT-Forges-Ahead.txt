DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Counterterrorism's IMT Forges Ahead<br>FROM: The CT IMT<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 11/26/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) By now you have all heard of Issue Management Teams and hopefully have a general<br>understanding of their roles and responsibilities. As members of the Counterterrorism IMT, we<br>want to share some of the things we are doing, to further educate you about IMTs in general,<br>but more importantly for us, to make you aware of some of the challenges we face, and if at all<br>appropriate, invite you to the corporate CT table.<br>(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Director has challenged the CT IMT to be the corporate conscience and<br>advocate for all that the United States SIGINT System (USSS) can bring to bear in the Global<br>War on Terror (GWOT). In this context, we are no different from the other IMTs. We have been<br>charged to optimize the USSS for our mission areas, to synchronize CT-related activities by<br>working to improve processes and fostering collaborative partnerships, and by striving to meet<br>the Agency's broader goals as defined by Transformation 2.0 and other initiatives. There is a<br>natural fit between the goals of infosharing and horizontal integration and the CT IMT's<br>objectives; they are, in fact, prerequisites for winning the GWOT.<br>(S//SI) To ensure the USSS is maximized to win the War on Terror, the CT IMT must collaborate<br>with myriad groups, organizations, and individuals. We are discovering that collaboration and<br>the sharing of information is critical for doing business. Not only must we strive for "joined at<br>the hip" partnerships with the organizations that have obvious CT roles to play, but we must<br>also make every effort to include, when appropriate, other partners whose roles may not be so<br>obvious. We have been challenged to make compelling cases for change by working with and<br>through the existing traditional organizational framework. We must partner with leaders across<br>SID on ways to improve our CT capabilities without undermining existing authorities or decisionmaking responsibilities. To ensure that expertise and energy are applied effectively for<br>maximum benefit to the mission the CT IMT created the Counterterrorism Planning Group<br>(CTPG). With representatives from across SID, IAD, and the Foreign Affairs Directorate (FAD)<br>the CTPG has the capability to reach far across and deep into the Enterprise. It is poised to get<br>the right experts and leaders together quickly to define and resolve CT-related issues, to<br>recognize challenges, and to break down barriers in order to seize opportunities and implement<br>creative solutions.<br>(S//SI) The CT IMT is currently working on an Operations Plan (OPLAN) to capture all the<br>excellent and worthwhile efforts that were underway in the CT arena before the IMT was<br>established. We are also working with the SIGINT Director and SID Staff to follow up on CTrelated issues that surfaced during the recent Site Commanders Operational Review (SCOR);<br>getting involved in understanding and representing SID and NSA in CT budget-related<br>processes; working with FAD to identify key CT gaps that could lead to new or changed foreign<br>partnerships; and supporting and steering corporate activities as they relate to Counterterrorism<br>(a recent CT assessment requested by the Pentagon is one example).<br>(U//FOUO) It is the global nature of the terrorist threat that makes it such a challenge for the<br>SIGINT system. How do we posture the best SIGINT collection capability in the world to win this<br>war? How can we better support our extraordinarily talented cadre of SIGINT Developers,<br>language analysts and analyst-reporters so they can stop "sprinting" (as many of them have<br>been doing since 9/11) and poise themselves to win the long haul "marathon" the GWOT<br>demands? How can we better partner with support organizations in the GWOT as they struggle<br>to meet their own constantly-changing set of competing priorities? These and many other<br>questions are what challenge the CT IMT every day.<br>(U//FOUO) The CT IMT welcomes your ideas, questions, and concerns. You can reach us at<br> or via email.
