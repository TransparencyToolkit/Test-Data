DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) SID and the Missile Defense Agency<br>FROM:<br>SID/Customer Gateway<br>Run Date: 09/08/2003<br><br>(S//SI) If we had only one word to sum up NSA's relationship with the Missile Defense Agency<br>(MDA) today, it might be "synergy." Tasked by presidential directive in 1984 to develop a<br>Ballistic Missile Defense System that can intercept enemy missiles in all phases of their flight,<br>the MDA (formerly the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization) initially focused on system-related<br>research, development, testing and evaluating activities. In recent months, however, MDA's<br>mission has expanded significantly.<br>(S//SI) In addition to conducting RDT&amp;E; activities, MDA analysts are now studying threat-based<br>issues - adversarial intentions and capabilities - with an eye to incorporating pertinent and useful<br>intelligence into the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), and ultimately increasing the<br>system's ability to defeat enemy missile attacks before they can be brought to bear against the<br>U.S., its allies, or friends. Towards this end, MDA has expanded its operations to include an<br>Intelligence Directorate that is eager to receive SIGINT that responds to MDA's new information<br>needs. In response, various components of the Signals Intelligence Directorate have joined<br>forces to improve and refine SIGINT delivery to this key customer.<br>(S//SI) With MDA's new focus on threat-based issues in mind, the NSA/CSS Representative for<br>Defense (NCR DEF) and Customer Account Management quickly went to work to identify existing<br>INs that would be of interest to MDA's analysts. Once these INs were identified, SIGINT Product<br>Services added MDA to the relevant distributions, allowing MDA's analysts to receive SIGINT<br>product directly from NSA for the first time. (Previously, product was routed through NCR DEF).<br>Another key player, Senior Executive Account Manager<br>, worked closely with A&amp;P;'s<br>leadership to ensure that S2 production lines were sensitive to MDA's information needs and<br>best prepared to service those needs. Now that MDA is fully engaged in the National SIGINT<br>Requirements Process, the SIGINT National Intelligence Officers for Strategic Programs and<br>Arms Control and DEFSMAC personnel are meeting regularly with MDA to establish a framework<br>for further refining missile defense intelligence requirements.<br>(C) MDA has called the relationship they have with NSA the most progressive and responsive of<br>all the intelligence organizations and are using this relationship as the model for working on<br>requirements and interactions with the other intelligence agencies. Anything we can do to<br>identify opportunities that will further support MDA's mission, enhance collaboration, and<br>increase information sharing will only make this relationship stronger.<br>(U//FOUO) For more information, please contact Customer Gateway's Account Manager for MDA,<br>, <br>@nsa,<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
