Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Deputy Director<br>Run Date: 04/01/2003<br><br>(S//SI) In my last message to you, I noted that SIGINT is wired into our military operations as<br>never before. A key role in this effort is played by SID analysts who have deployed to the field,<br>providing direct support to our customers--and we need your help in ensuring that this vital<br>support continues.<br>(S//SI) Our deployed analysts are working closely with military intelligence staff: passing them<br>SIGINT, providing analysis, and fusing data. Their work has a direct and crucial impact on our<br>military operations, potentially saving lives. NSA and our customers owe a debt of gratitude to<br>these analysts who have made personal sacrifices to contribute to the war effort. They have<br>done outstanding work!<br>(S//SI) There is an urgent need, however, for additional analysts to fill these positions. I urge<br>both military and civilian SIGINT analysts to consider volunteering for 90-120 day NIST<br>(National Intelligence Support Team) deployments--your contribution could be key to our<br>success.
