DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) 3 1/2 Months in Qatar: Supporting CENTCOM<br>FROM:<br>IA Intern<br>Run Date: 11/24/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) My tour with Central Command was probably my best<br>experience at NSA, and perhaps the least expected as well. I<br>volunteered to deploy to Central Command's Forward<br>Headquarters at Camp As Saliyah, Qatar in early January 2003<br>with others from CSG CENTCOM in Tampa. I was one of only two<br>civilian intelligence analysts who deployed to Qatar before OIF<br>(Operation Iraqi Freedom) began.<br>(TS//SI//REL) Working in the High-Value Targets cell during my<br>time in Qatar, our mission was to locate any of the leadership<br>figures in the Iraqi regime. At any given time, the team consisted<br>of two NSA/CSG analysts, one or two imagery analysts, and<br>several all-source analysts from CENTCOM. Most of our work<br>focused on Personal Communications Service (PCS) devices, Iraqi<br>regime security communications, Inmarsat, and High-Powered<br>Cordless Phones (HPCP). During the weeks leading up to 20 March,<br>we were actively developing new targets on our own and in<br>conjunction with analysts at NSAW. Developing targets in the field<br>represented a unique and groundbreaking experience, and in<br>several instances, new targets were independently generated.<br>Previously unknown Iraqi regime personalities were uncovered,<br>often based on the collocation of PCS and security communications<br>devices. Nevertheless, we constantly liaised with our analytic<br>counterparts at NSAW, and relied on their expertise to fine-tune<br>our work in the field.<br>(U//FOUO) I first heard of the outbreak of war like everyone else from the news... except my news was a bit less sophisticated.<br>Around 5:00 AM on 20 March, while half-awake in my bunk bed, I<br>tuned my short-wave radio to a faint Voice of America station in<br>Egypt broadcasting the news of the first strike.<br>(TS//SI//REL) Once OIF began, SIGINT information played an<br>extremely valuable role in tracking leadership figures. TimeSensitive Targeting (or TSTs) were often announced in the HVT cell<br>when tippers alerted us to priority PCS activity. In several<br>instances, this SIGINT information - in combination with other<br>intelligence - led to direct attacks on these targets. In other cases,<br>HUMINT sources provided information to the HVT cell, and we<br>would attempt to substantiate this information through the<br>presence of SIGINT activity. Needless to say, the success of the<br>HVT cell hinged on the fusion of all sources of intelligence.<br>(TS//SI//REL) The close collaboration between CSG CENTCOM and<br>NSAW was demonstrated on 2 April when, after urgent analysis by<br>GEOCELL, CSG CENTCOM, and MENA, a facility near the Iraqi<br>Intelligence Service Headquarters was destroyed because of hostile<br>communications emanating from its grounds. Analyst-to-analyst<br>cooperation in this example proved to be decisive in quickly<br>prosecuting this dangerous target.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) IA Interns<br>Abroad<br>1.
