As noted in a previous SIDtoday article<br>, the tool allows voice conversation, messaging, collaboration on documents, etc. The decision to<br>hold this and subsequent meetings was made by the leadership group as a way to work together<br>to advance the 5-Eyes Business Vision , which they prepared earlier this year.<br>(U//FOUO) Most of the IWS discussion, which lasted over an hour, was centered on efforts<br>against terrorism, especially ways to extend cooperation across the SIGINT community, and to<br>include the HUMINT community. The leaders agreed to schedule another session around the<br>middle of January.<br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
