A certificate<br>program, consisting of eight different courses, will be offered during duty hours at NSA and will<br>provide SIGINT Directorate analysts state-of-art training in GIS. This program, sponsored by the<br>Analysis and Production Directorate, has been brought to NSA as a result of a partnership with<br>George Mason University, one of the leading academic providers of GIS learning. It represents a<br>first of its kind and a major step forward in the A&amp;P; goals for rebuilding analysis. Courses will<br>be scheduled over an eight month period and students will need to make a commitment to<br>complete the program.<br>(U) NOMINATION ACTION: If you are currently in a job where GIS is an analytical tool or in a<br>job where a GIS requirement has been recognized, and you are able to make a serious, strict<br>commitment of three full days approximately every four weeks beginning in September 2003,<br>with a break in December, and ending in May 2004, please review the course description/outline<br>below and forward the following completed via email to<br>, by COB 08<br>August 2003 .<br>COURSE TITLE: George Mason GIS Certificate Program<br>DATE: See Below for title/date of each course offering<br>FULL NAME:<br>SSN (for registration purposes):<br>ORGANIZATION DESIGNATOR:<br>SUPERVISOR concurs: Name of Supervisor<br>Justification:<br>(U) JUSTIFICATION: Individual applications will be evaluated for acceptance based on the<br>information submitted in the student justification.
