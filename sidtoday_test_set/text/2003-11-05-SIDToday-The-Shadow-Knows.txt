I recently had the chance to walk a mile (at least!) and spend 12 hours with SID Director<br>MG Richard Quirk under the "Shadow the SIGINT Director" program . This program<br>represents a rejuvenation of Ms. Baginski's original "Shadow-a-Senior" program, and provides<br>the opportunity for SID's "average Joe's" to spend the day trying to keep up with one very<br>dynamic General.<br>(U//FOUO) As a seasoned SIGINT-er and occasional cynic, my original interest in the shadowing<br>program was based in a desire to get a view of Transformation initiatives from the top to<br>balance the "trickle down" effect we so often get at the other end of the management chain.<br>During the course of one very long day, I had the chance to gain an understanding of the types<br>of issues routinely handled by SID's senior management, garner the salient points of initiatives<br>underway to move us ahead in the Transformation process, and recognize the themes woven<br>across many topics and meetings. These all represented issues important to General Quirk in<br>regards to NSA's role as the Signals Intelligence authority.<br>(U//FOUO) Over the course of marathon meetings, one-on-ones, and phone calls, I experienced<br>several revelations. One was the frequency with which the SID Director must act as a bridge<br>between divergent views on SIGINT policy issues; MG Quirk was often a facilitator between our<br>own SIGINT leaders and other elements both within and outside NSA. Another very pleasant<br>revelation for me was the importance to which MG Quirk assigns the responsibility of the SID<br>Director to address critical operational issues - specifically shortfalls - and to incorporate<br>ultimate operational responsibility as part of the SID Director's leadership protocol.<br>(C) The breadth of topics to which I gained exposure ranged from new databasing systems and<br>continual fostering of our foreign partner relationships to future visions of vital areas such as<br>NSOC and the leadership of SID itself. One of the many common threads recognizable across<br>the spectrum of meetings that constitute the SID Director's day is General Quirk's emphasis on<br>unifying the efforts of tactical SIGINT units, NSA HQ, and the Extended Enterprise to form a<br>cohesive and unified cryptologic architecture. You can't gain insight like this by relying on staff<br>meeting notes. While I must confess to a certain trepidation before I participated in the Shadow<br>the SID Director program, it is without any reservation that I recommend it to those interested<br>in gaining an understanding of NSA's strategic SIGINT vision and, perhaps, to those who want<br>affirmation of the need to "assume (the) noble intent" of those leading our SIGINT efforts.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
