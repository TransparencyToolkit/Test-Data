DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Hiring (part 1: Outlook)<br>FROM: Maria Magoulas-Perkins<br>Chief, SIGINT People Office<br>Run Date: 04/29/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) We are fortunate that with a Congressional supplemental, SID will hire more than<br>500 people this year and will likely have comparable hiring programs in the years to come. The<br>SIGINT People Office wants to remind all SID hiring managers to continue moving full steam<br>ahead to keep the hiring pipeline filled with the most qualified applicants. It is imperative that<br>we keep working to satisfy our hiring requisitions. This includes bringing in applicants,<br>conducting interviews, extending offers, and providing candidates with security forms in order to<br>get them through the necessary processing.<br>(U//FOUO) Currently SID hiring is focused strongly on the ongoing campaigns. However, per<br>agreement between the SID Chief of Staff and Chief HRS, and per previous guidance from Chief<br>HRS to continue to hire qualified applicants, please ensure that applicants are not being turned<br>away because of hiring allocations (or lack thereof), but only because they do not have the<br>requisite skills for the job you have to fill. No one should be turned away because of lack of<br>billets/hiring allocations, etc.<br>(U//FOUO) As a SID hiring manager, when/if you are faced with this situation, please advise<br>your respective hiring authority of your requirement(s) and they will coordinate with the SIGINT<br>People Office. The SIGINT People Office will raise the issue to the SID Chief of Staff for<br>resolution. The list of SID hiring authorities can be found here.<br>(U) Coming in part 2 of this message: Welcoming New Hires<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
