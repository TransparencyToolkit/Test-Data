The need to understand this technology has been<br>compounded by the need to provide force protection in Iraq. Emphasis on metadata analysis and<br>target development is paramount in prosecuting the targets using this technology.<br>(S//SI) The HAC, founded by SSG in May 2003 to provide the community a focal point for HPCP<br>issues, is hosting this conference to coordinate the HPCP effort, eliminate duplication of effort,<br>and facilitate the sharing of information and technology throughout the Intelligence Community.<br>Although attendance is filling up fast, conference registration is still available at the Conference<br>Website (or type "go hpcp").<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
