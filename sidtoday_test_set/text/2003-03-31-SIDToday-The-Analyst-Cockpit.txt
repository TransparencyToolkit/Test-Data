Every day you open up separate tools: email, the calendar, Anchory,<br>AMHS, and the SIRO Press Review. But what if you had one place you could go for all of it? What<br>if you could have a unified query of traffic, references, and open source information? Soon you<br>will, with the Analyst Cockpit.<br>(U//FOUO) What does the Analyst Cockpit look like, and how does it work? The Analyst Cockpit<br>screen is cleanly laid out. At the top are a few basic hyperlinks and a "Quick Lookup" search<br>engine. Below are the "portlets," or sections, with your profiled retrievals organized by<br>categories. There's also an event history (similar to that used by amazon.com), in case you<br>need to get back to something you've already looked at.<br>(S//SI) Tools (dictionaries, Anchory, SIRO Press Review, etc.) get hooked up to the cockpit.<br>Getting to the tools is easy; there's only one sign-on. When you log in, the system will first<br>authenticate you. Then the information YOU need will appear before you. What comes up on<br>your screen will be tailored, using portal technology, so that you won't have to do the extraction.<br>You simply customize your profile, and it does the rest. For example, as it is now, you might call<br>up the SIRO Press Review to see if there's any news on your target country. You then have to<br>scan the whole document to see if your country shows up. With the Analyst Cockpit, you'll only<br>see the section on your target. In addition, news on your target country will appear together in<br>one portlet from a variety of sources: the SIRO Press Review, Video News Service, Global<br>SIGINT Highlights, etc. Having these results all together will provide a more mission-driven<br>cockpit.<br>(TS//SI) Some other features of the Analyst Cockpit include:<br>Click and Send: This will provide "hooks" between two tools. For example, you can look<br>up a phone number, then update a database or task the number.<br>A Shopping Cart: You can save items to work on later. Customization/Personalization:<br>Customization is what you'll see based on your work role.<br>Personalization is your tailored view of how you want to see everything.<br>Freeform Work Area: This is a workspace where analysts can gather, analyze, and share<br>information.<br>(S//SI) This April, 28 users will begin testing the new Analyst Cockpit prototype. In September,<br>there will be 150 analysts testing it. This is a prototype, but it will form the basis for the real<br>version that you'll be able to use in the fall of 2004. If you'd like to see a demonstration, you<br>may register for any of the "Open Sessions" in April at:<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
