This belief, in part, is based on<br>the fact that HF is one of the oldest means of communications,<br>recently celebrating its 100-year anniversary. As newer<br>technologies, such as satellites and fiber optic cables, were<br>introduced as alternate means of communicating, it was believed<br>that the market for HF technologies would disappear. This has not<br>happened. In fact, the market for HF continues to grow.<br>(S//SI) Why is this? HF requires no terrestrial or spaceborne<br>infrastructure to communicate globally and is capable of surviving<br>the effects of a nuclear blast. HF is a low cost way to communicate<br>and is often used when other traditional paths are denied to a user<br>(usually in times of war). For as little as $5000, a state-of-the-art<br>radio can be purchased that will enable the user to communicate in<br>voice, send a fax, transmit data computer-to-computer, and even<br>replicate a "STU" capability at distances of thousands of miles. HF<br>radios are mobile, rugged, and require minimal manpower and<br>training to operate-- ideal for use by terrorists and third world<br>military organizations.<br>(TS//SI) As the United States was considering its options regarding<br>a Security Council resolution on Iraq, intelligence derived from HF<br>collection provided the position and voting intentions of several key<br>players.<br>(TS//SI) HF played a major role in tracking<br><br>.<br>(TS//SI) Yet another example of the importance of HF <br><br> <br><br>(TS//SI) During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the importance of having<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Data<br>Acquisition<br>1.

As part of the planning for this<br>war, CENTCOM developed a SIGINT herding strategy.<br>Communications hubs known to be used by Iraqi military were<br>identified and prioritized. The elimination of these hubs forced the<br>Iraqis to establish alternate means of communicating. The alternate<br>means of communicating very often became HF communications<br>because of the reasons cited above. In this war one of the primary<br>users of HF was Iraq's Air Defense visual observers (VISOPS)<br>whose mission was to monitor and report on coalition aircraft overflights and ground troop movements. VISOPS, as well as other air<br>defense elements and Republican Guard elements, had been noted<br>using HF communications extensively. Our ground troops leveraged<br>this information for Indications and Warning (I&amp;W;) and Force<br>protection. As the war continued, we were well postured to address<br>increases and trends in Iraqi HF activity.<br>(U//FOUO) Corporate HF Services (CHS) recently drafted a<br>strategic plan that outlines the way forward for continued<br>HF/UHF/VHF sustained collection. The plan calls for substantial<br>changes to investment in both pay and non-pay. The investment in<br>HF pay will be dramatically reduced as a result of automation and<br>changing the way we do business. The investment in non-pay will<br>increase to allow NSA to automate functions and catch up with<br>advances in technology. A draft of the plan will soon be available<br>on the CHS home page .<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
