I echo that pride, both for those whose mission was specifically linked to OIF and for<br>those who by diligent attention to their mission made our focus on OIF possible.<br>(S) An important message for the Signals Intelligence Directorate can be found at the end of the<br>second paragraph in the Director's WARgram, it reads: "Although major combat is over, Iraq is<br>still a troubled environment and much work needs to be done."
