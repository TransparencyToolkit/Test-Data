DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Office Manager: Jack-of-All-Trades<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/10/2003<br><br>(U) A good office manager can make a whole office function better. That's what I remind myself<br>as I come to work every day. Our actions help keep the operational wheels spinning, in ways<br>that may be invisible to the workforce at large... but if we did our job poorly, the effects would<br>be very noticeable.<br>(U) We play many roles. We keep supervisors' calendars, arrange travel, handle visitor<br>requests, correspondence, timesheets, action tracking, deliver mail, take care of the office<br>equipment, budgeting, logistics and space, etc. We are often asked to serve as the OSHA<br>representative, CWF rep and the records person.<br>(U) Beyond this, Office Managers make an equally important - but even more subtle contribution, by helping to keep morale in an office high. When we greet people as they enter<br>the room, a friendly attitude can give all visitors a more positive feeling. Often people look to us<br>to keep them informed about what's going on. Office Managers also are a manager's eyes and<br>ears: we can keep them aware of the concerns that the workforce has on a given issue. Our<br>relationship with the managers is a partnership. And although it's not one of our main duties, we<br>sometimes help arrange morale-building functions, to improve relationships and strengthen<br>communication.<br>(U) What does it take to be an office manager? We used to be called Secretaries, then Office<br>Assistants, and now Office Managers - our expectations have greatly increased. The job requires<br>many traits: communications skills, tact, flexibility, self-starter, the ability to work<br>independently, and negotiating skills, to name just a few! Being a "people person" is of<br>paramount importance. One must also be able to multi-task; we are often pulled in several<br>directions, and we must be able to switch from one action to another and back very quickly.<br>Networking is another key skill. I often contact people if I haven't heard from them in a while - I<br>think it's good to keep the channels of communication open.<br>(U) What's the best aspect of the job? I like the contact with people, for one. I also like the fact<br>that the job is challenging, ever-changing, and fast-paced. I am always learning something new!<br>I also enjoy assisting my coworkers and generating a solution or answer. In a conference room<br>one day, someone asked my manager if a certain seat at the "conference table" (where the<br>other managers were sitting) was reserved. "Yes," he said, "it's reserved for my Office Manager,<br>!" It's nice to be respected like that.<br>(U) The hard part of the job is that sometimes people don't fully appreciate our capabilities and<br>take advantage of them. Office Managers are problem-solvers by profession who can handle<br>very complex tasks; I believe we are capable of taking on even more demanding duties that will<br>put our skills to the best use. In dealing with these issues, I have found it very helpful to have<br>mentors. I periodically meet with three senior personnel who "know the ropes." I have learned<br>much from them, and owe them my gratitude for helping me succeed here at the Agency.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
