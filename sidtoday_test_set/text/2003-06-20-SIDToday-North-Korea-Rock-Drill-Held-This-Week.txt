DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(S//SI) North Korea Rock Drill Held This Week<br>FROM: the North Korean Issue Management Team<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 06/20/2003<br><br>(S//SI) This week, from 16-17 June, the North Korean (NK) Issue Management Team (IMT)<br>conducted the first in a series of NK Rock Drills. This effort is in keeping with the Director's<br>charge to build on best practices/lessons learned from Iraq-- with a focus on preparing the<br>cryptologic system to support policymakers and warfighters. Subject matter experts were<br>assembled from across the cryptologic community to assess the NSA/CSS posture against North<br>Korea. Over 80 representatives from 31 NSA/CSS organizations across the Enterprise attended<br>the two-day session. The Rock Drill consisted of a series of information briefs and small-group<br>discussions. Numerous issues and gaps concerning our current capabilities were identified, and<br>the results are posted on the North Korean IMT web page (or type "go nk").<br>(S//SI) The first day's session commenced with opening remarks by SID Director MG Quirk, then<br>launched into a series of briefs from each of 15 presenting organizations, starting with the<br>NSAW Directorates, SUSLAK (Senior U.S. Liaison Advisor-Korea), moving through the SID<br>Deputy Directorates, MSOC (Misawa Security Operations Center), Kunia RSOC and the CSS/SCE<br>components, and ending with a discussion of the military OPLANS for Korea (complete agenda<br>and briefing slides are posted on the "go nk" web site). On the second day, small group<br>discussions, facilitated by OPSIGINT, identified key issues and gaps raised during the first day.<br>The small groups focused on Access, Collection, Production and Dissemination/Interoperability<br>topic areas and captured/prioritized the essential 3-5 gaps in each area. The large group<br>reassembled after a break to review the reports from each topic area. The slides from these<br>briefs are posted on the "go nk" web at the TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL level.<br>(S//SI) While Rock Drill-1 was limited to the NSA/CSS community and focused on our current<br>posture, future Rock Drills will include Second Parties, SIGINT and Information Assurance<br>customers as well as other Intelligence Community members. Rock Drill-2 will be hosted by MG<br>Quirk and is scheduled for 5 August 0800-1100, Room 9A135 (date changed from 23 July).<br>Participants will be at the senior level, in contrast to the working-level nature of Rock Drill-1.<br>During Rock Drill-2 the IMT will review the progress of the NK Multi-INT Review; provide an<br>analysis of NK Priority-2 Information Needs (which represent 70% of total INs); and present an<br>overview of Rock Drill-1 which will focus on addressing the NK issues and gaps agreed upon in<br>Rock Drill-1, as well as recommend a "way-ahead" in resolving these challenges.<br>(S//SI) Aside from discussing important NK issues, Rock Drill-1 afforded the opportunity for<br>visitors from CONUS and OCONUS to interact with NSAW Korean hands by building new<br>relationships or renewing old acquaintances. While the evaluation forms collected have yet to be<br>reviewed, it is the general consensus that Rock Drill-1 was a success and participants look<br>forward to playing in future Korea Rock Drills!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
