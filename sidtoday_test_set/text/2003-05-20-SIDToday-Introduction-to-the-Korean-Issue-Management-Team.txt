DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Introduction to the Korean Issue Management Team<br>FROM: the Korean Issue Management Team<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 05/20/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) This past November the SID Director introduced you to the "Issue Manager Team"<br>construct. In February 2003, the "Korean Issue Management Team" (KIMT) was formed and<br>consists of members from Customer Relationships <br>), Analysis and Production (Fran<br>Fleish), and Data Acquisition (<br>). The KIMT is established to identify North Korean<br>SIGINT gaps, prioritize them, and challenge the enterprise to respond with solutions. The KIMT's<br>objective is to "bind the bubbles" with the SID Director's authority to leverage people and<br>resources in a quiet way to get their job done. Our goal is to transform how we do business,<br>optimize our resources and provide increased value to our customers. Because KIMT's potential<br>is so great for the Enterprise, we want to keep you updated on our progress.<br>(S//SI) On 11 March, the KIMT briefed the NSA/CSS Long Term SIGINT Strategy against North<br>Korea to the 2nd Qtr/FY03 SIGINT Enterprise Quarterly Executive Leadership Conference held at<br>Fort Belvoir, Virginia. As a result of the brief, the KIMT was tasked to use the six SID Operating<br>Principles to conduct an analysis of the Priority-1 NK Information Needs (INs). This effort was<br>completed and briefed to the SID Executive Leadership Board (ELB) on 16 April. The Team is<br>currently completing an assessment of the Priority-2 NK INs, which combined with the Priority-1<br>INs, will account for approximately 75% of all NK INs.<br>(S//SI) A lesson learned from the Iraq IMT was that we are increasingly working intelligence<br>issues that do not correlate to any one Intelligence Community (IC) organization. Additionally,<br>we discovered that seamless work across the entire Enterprise is critical to bridging the threatbased and capability-based SIGINT system. To be effective, we must plan meticulously to<br>produce SIGINT with an unwavering focus for our customer needs. Therefore, the KIMT is<br>coordinating a Multi-INT Review, with other Intelligence Community partners, to map customer<br>key decisions/interests on NK, to stated customer INs and then determine which IC Agency has<br>the lead for each IN. Additionally, the KIMT is planning a series of NK Rock-Drills in the JuneJuly timeframe. The first Rock-Drill will focus on coordinating, at the working level, short and<br>mid-term cryptologic planning activities on NK. This effort will include organizations throughout<br>the Enterprise, to include Service Cryptologic Elements (SCE's), key customers and other IC<br>partners. The second Drill will facilitate senior-level discussions on the Multi-INT Review and a<br>wrap-up of the first NK Rock-Drill.<br>(S//SI) We expect the results of these activities to optimize our overall capability against NK,<br>providing the best possible SIGINT support to our customers. This effort is all about integrated<br>planning and disciplined execution across the Enterprise. You'll be hearing more about the MulitINT Review and NK Rock Drills so stay tuned!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
