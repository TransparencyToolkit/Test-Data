DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) OIF Awards Update<br>FROM:<br>SID Workforce Performance Management Executive<br>Run Date: 10/27/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) We again would like to thank everyone for all the hard work for both supporting<br>Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and for playing position so that OIF could be such a SIGINT<br>success. Although many have received awards recently for both efforts, we would like to<br>highlight the OIF award results because of the special funding involved. As you know from<br>previous correspondence , NSA received $2.5 million from Congress as a sign of appreciation for<br>our contributions to OIF. SID initially received $528,000, but this was eventually supplemented<br>with some of the funds from the other "pots" and SID ultimately received about $1 million in<br>funding.<br>(U//FOUO) SID gave out 124 team awards, which included cash awards of varying amounts to<br>825 people and hundreds of Time-Off Awards and Letters of Appreciation (LOA) from the SIGINT<br>Director. In addition, SID awarded 71 individual awards - although teaming was a major theme<br>throughout the write-ups. The military are also being rewarded for their OIF efforts: to date,<br>194 JSAMs, 33 JSCMs, and 4 DMSMs** have been written and more are coming in all the time.<br>There have also been hundreds of Time-Off awards, LOAs, and STAR awards for the military.<br>(U//FOUO) SID tried to have a fair and balanced process to level the playing field so that like<br>accomplishments were rewarded with like compensation. This was done through our normal<br>award processes. Therefore, SID has decided not to publish the list of OIF award recipients.<br>**<br>JSAM=Joint Service Achievement Medals <br>JSCM=Joint Service Commendation Medal <br>DMSM=Defense Meritorious Service Medal<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
