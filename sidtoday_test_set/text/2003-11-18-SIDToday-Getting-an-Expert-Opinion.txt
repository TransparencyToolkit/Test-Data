DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Getting an Expert Opinion<br>FROM:<br>Deputy Branch Chief, PRC Defense Industries<br>Run Date: 11/18/2003<br><br>(S//SI) When NSA analysts work with highly technical subject matter, the insights and<br>specialized knowledge of a subject matter expert are invaluable in helping explain what's really<br>going on. What's more, the best time to apply that expertise from across the Intelligence<br>Community (IC) is before the SIGINT report is published. What's the best way to make this<br>happen?<br>(S//SI) The Chinese Defense Industries Branch (S2B33), in its role as the Target Operational<br>Pilot (TOP), has been working on just such a project: the E-document Sharing Program . This<br>pilot will allow S2B33 analysts to share Evaluated Minimized Traffic (EMT) - i.e. SIGINT that has<br>potential intelligence value, stripped of any references to its origin or other sensitive information<br>- with a limited set of IC subject matter experts.<br>(S//SI) This collaboration mechanism will not replace established NSA reporting formats:<br>information in the documents cannot be further disseminated or referenced until officially<br>published by NSA. The EMT documents will be shared via a virtual meeting and document<br>storage locale using the Information Workspace (IWS) collaboration tool. There will be an IWS<br>virtual room established on the Intelligence Community Collaborative Presence (ICCP) server,<br>accessible through PKI certification, where S2B33 analysts will post EMT for review and<br>discussion.<br>(C//SI) This E-document Sharing Program differs from an existing TOP effort called the PartTime Integree Program , in which IC analysts work in NSA's physical spaces for short periods on<br>a scheduled basis. While this existing program (it began over a year ago) has amply<br>demonstrated the benefits of increased formal collaboration, its approach is not always the best<br>option, especially when the subject matter experts have to travel long distances.<br>(U//FOUO) Both of these programs - the Part-Time Integree Program and the E-document<br>Sharing Program - represent exciting advances in information sharing and movement toward<br>Transformation 2.0. They reflect the ingenuity of the work force and a tangible advance in<br>providing better SIGINT for our customers.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
