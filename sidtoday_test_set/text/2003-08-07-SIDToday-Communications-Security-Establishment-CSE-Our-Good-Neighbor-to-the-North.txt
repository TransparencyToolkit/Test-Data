Throughout much of its history, CSE has contributed<br>to the safety and prosperity of the United States and Canada<br>through its ability to master the strategic Cold War threat. Today,<br>CSE is focused on mastering the global information infrastructure.<br>(U//FOUO) In December 2001, Canada passed Anti-Terrorism<br>legislation that confirmed CSE's existing mandate and added new<br>authorities. This legislation, together with increased resources, as<br>well as some unique accesses arising from Canada's geographical<br>and technical niches, put CSE in a great position to make a<br>difference to the SIGINT community. (See CSE's SIGINT homepage<br>HERE ).<br>(S//SI) CSE's technical and financial contributions to the<br>development of SIGINT solutions, as well as bilateral projects such<br>as CATAPULT help advance key objectives and promote the<br>overarching SIGINT agenda. CSE is especially focused on working<br>with NSA to tackle our common North American Security priorities ,<br>including terrorism, proliferation and cyber threat . In fact, CSE<br>plans to dedicate 40 percent of its SIGINT resources to security<br>initiatives. CSE wants to master SIGINT Development , and make it<br>the foundation of all its access and analysis programs.<br>(S//SI) Providing support to military operations is also a priority<br>for CSE. Canada provides troops to coalition forces deployed<br>abroad, e.g., Afghanistan, and CSE together with Canadian Forces<br>Information Operations Group are responsible for the cryptologic<br>services that accompany the troops.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U//FOUO) Second Party<br>SIGINT Cooperation<br>1.
