DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) One Last Mo-Gram: Thank You<br>FROM: Maureen Baginski<br>Sigint Director<br>Run Date: 04/18/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) Overwhelmed is not a word I use often, but it's the right word to<br>describe how I feel in the face of all the email wishes, kind words, hugs,<br>cards, and remembrances I've received since making the announcement of<br>my move to the FBI. I've been very humbled by the outpouring of understanding, support and<br>kindness--humbled, because I believe in your sincerity for two reasons: 1) as a person I try my<br>best to always assume noble intent, and 2) as an analyst, reasoning based on evidence tells me<br>there's no earthly reason for anyone to suck up to me any longer! :)<br>(U//FOUO) I told you before what an emotion-filled decision this was for me, and now I know<br>why. All of you in some very special way have touched my life. I have so many great memories<br>of my time at NSA, and they all center on the enduring relationships that have been built as we<br>pursued our mission to defend the nation. When I think back on what might be considered<br>seminal moments in my time at NSA, it's not the operational or analytic details I remember--it's<br>the faces and names of the people with whom I shared the experience. In the end, any<br>professional accomplishment I may have enjoyed occurred because of the generosity of human<br>spirit, intellect, and dedication that is the hallmark of the NSA workforce. In many ways it's as if<br>I grew up here. It's a privilege to have learned something from every family member I've<br>encountered. I shall forever treasure all the lessons I learned, but three will stay with me<br>forever: 1) Leaders and managers work for the people---not the other way around; 2) Never<br>confuse your personal importance with that of your position; and 3) Laugh often and well--it<br>truly is the best medicine.<br>(U//FOUO) In my last day as SIGINT Director, I'd like to challenge you to always remember that<br>we protect the nation in three ways:<br> <br>By the information we produce<br>By protecting the rights of U.S. citizens<br>By using the nation's resources responsibly.<br> <br>(U//FOUO) Starting 5 May I'll be protecting the same nation in the same way from a new<br>location and I look forward to working with you in a new way. Again, it's truly been an honor to<br>serve with you.<br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
