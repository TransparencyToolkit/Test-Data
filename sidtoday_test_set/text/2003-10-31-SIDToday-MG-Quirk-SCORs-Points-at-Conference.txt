The General went on to say this year's SCOR has two purposes:<br>1.  Determine how to make SIGINT as responsive as possible to the conditions in today's<br>dangerous world; and<br>2.  Determine how to coordinate SIGINT in a modern, 21st century way.<br>Put another way, "How do we move from running Dad's hardware store to being Chairman of the<br>Board of Home Depot?"<br>(U//FOUO) The SID Director gave the site commanders a thumbnail of how SID got to where it is<br>today, beginning with "Get it, Know It, Use It". He then introduced the newly expanded Issue<br>Management Team (IMT) concept to the conference attendees, telling them this is how<br>horizontal integration begins in SID.<br>(U//FOUO) The SCOR is a three-day conference being attended by more than 40 site<br>commanders, operations chiefs, chiefs of staff and NCR's (National Cryptologic Representatives).<br>The conference gives the site commanders - from across the world - an opportunity to come<br>together and participate in the strategic planning for the enterprise, and to hear firsthand from<br>the SIGINT Director where the enterprise is headed.
