Remarkably, it<br>took Data Acquisition's Tactical Platforms organization only 60 days to build, test, and field a<br>system to satisfy this requirement.<br>(S//SI) The result was MINUTEMAN PROMETHEUS, a Pelican case-mounted, man-portable<br>system. Tactical Platforms used commercially-available technology and existing<br>hardware/software and built them into a unique system designed from the ground up, which<br>enabled a low cost per system. The project was a joint effort, with MINUTEMAN acting as<br>deployment lead and providing hardware, MUSKETEER providing software, and the Army<br>Cryptologic Office providing technical and financial mission support.<br>(S//SI) Deployment of this capability allows Special Forces teams to conduct close-in collection<br>against adversaries in Afghan "hot spots" to obtain real-time indications and warning and<br>targeting information. MINUTEMAN PROMETHEUS serves as an example of how, through<br>collaboration, SID can use existing capabilities to respond quickly to customer needs. With the<br>collection environment evolving at an ever-increasing pace, this adaptability will help us stay a<br>step ahead of the game!<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
