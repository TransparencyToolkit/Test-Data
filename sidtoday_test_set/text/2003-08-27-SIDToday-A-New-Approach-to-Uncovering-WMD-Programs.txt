DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(C) A New Approach to Uncovering WMD Programs<br>FROM:<br>Advanced Analysis Lab<br>Run Date: 08/27/2003<br><br>(S) The National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) lays out a daunting<br>challenge: "Detect, identify, locate, disrupt, seize, and destroy an adversary's WMD<br>assets, means of delivery, and associated facilities before the weapons are used."<br>Many foreign countries hide their true intentions by employing dual-use technology. Advances in<br>science and technology that help the civilian sector can also, for example, make it easier for<br>biological warfare (BW) specialists to make more lethal strains and weaponize them with greater<br>efficiency.<br>(C) Here's the question: can we model the end-to-end processes used to produce substances for<br>benign civilian use? ...and from that baseline, can we then determine the specific features that<br>would distinguish a Bio Warfare Program from a benign civilian pharmaceutical production<br>effort?<br>(S) These are some of the questions the Advanced Analysis Lab hopes to answer as it<br>undertakes a collaborative project with:<br>Intelligence Analysts from four Product Lines (Middle East North Africa, Proliferation and<br>Arms Control, Regional Targets, and Geospatial Exploitation);<br>Modelers using Complex Additive Systems Analysis (CASA); and<br>Engineers from Lawrence Livermore National Labs.<br>(S//SI) As the project unfolds, other colleagues will be included as the need arises. A suspect<br>Iranian BW facility will be chosen for the proof of concept. Computational models will be built to<br>identify and process data that sheds light on the facility's function. Both classified and<br>unclassified sources will be used: email and fax traffic, voice transcripts, imagery, open source<br>publications, and Auto CAD files. CASA will provide a dynamic environment for analyzing this<br>varied data set; this will include developing and validating both engineering and human-oriented<br>models in an integrated environment.<br>(U//FOUO) The project falls in line with the Advanced Analysis Lab's mandate to create and<br>foster advanced tradecraft. The CASA approach is inherently designed to be applicable across<br>many target sets, so success here could lead to progress against other targets as well.<br>Note: The National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction can be found in National<br>Security Presidential Directive NSPD-17.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
