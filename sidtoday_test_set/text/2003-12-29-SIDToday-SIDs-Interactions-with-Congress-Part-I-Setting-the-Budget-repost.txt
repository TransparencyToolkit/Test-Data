That is why our dealings with Congress are so important. In this series, we'll look at how<br>SID interacts with Congress-- we think you'll be surprised at how much work goes into this<br>effort, most of it invisible to the general SID workforce. The focal point within SID for these<br>interactions is SID Legislative Affairs (SID LA).<br>(U//FOUO) Our main contacts in Congress are with the following four committees:<br>House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI)<br>Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)<br>House Appropriations Committee (HAC)<br>Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC)<br>For budgeting purposes, the first two committees are known as "authorizors", while the latter<br>two are the "appropriators". Let's look briefly at the budget process (we'll try to keep it<br>simple!)...<br>(U) The Budget<br>(U) "Marking Up" the President's Budget<br>(U//FOUO) Since Congress controls the governmental purse strings, many of our dealings with<br>Congress are related to budget issues. The process works like this:<br>The President submits a budget to Congress (with SID's portion detailed in a document<br>called the Congressional Budget Justification Book - CBJB) requesting specified amounts<br>of money for NSA and 12 other agencies that are part of the National Foreign Intelligence<br>Program. Every year, NSA's DF2 (Accounting and Financial Services) puts together the<br>CBJB based on input from SID and the rest of the Agency, excluding IAD.<br>The above four congressional committees then review the CBJB and "mark it up"- i.e.<br>they indicate whether they think the funding should be raised, lowered, or left the same.<br>The committee staffers also may request briefings on various projects, to help them<br>gauge the appropriate level of funding.<br>The congressional committees then reconcile (this is referred to as "conference") the<br>various versions of their mark ups, which result in the Intelligence Authorization Bill and<br>the Intelligence Appropriation Bill. At that point, it is submitted to the full Congress for a<br>vote and (if passed) sent to the President for signature or veto.<br>(U) More on the CBJB<br>(U//FOUO) The compilation of the CBJB is a major project. Personnel from NSA's DF3 (Program<br>and Budget Build) coordinate with SID budget managers to gather together cost figures and<br>justifications for every program across the directorate and present the data in a consistent<br>format for the congressional committees. The CBJB is due to the committees on the first Monday<br>in February. The recently completed Fiscal Year 2004 CBJB totaled 761 pages, and took 5<br>months to assemble.<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
