DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Veteran's Day Observance<br>FROM: SGM<br>, USA<br>SID Senior Enlisted Advisor<br>Run Date: 11/10/2003<br><br>(U) As the new SID SEA, I am humbled to be with you today as a part of such a great<br>organization. I appreciate the efforts of both the military and civilian personnel that have made<br>the Signals Intelligence Directorate an integral part of the National Security Agency and the<br>United States SIGINT system. I am also honored to share my thoughts on Veteran's Day with<br>each of you. Veteran's Day sparks childhood memories of learning the Pledge of Allegiance and<br>standing for the National Anthem. Even at a young age, I appreciated patriotism, but it wasn't<br>until much later that I learned the meaning of Veteran's Day. Yes, we studied the typical dates<br>and places in school, however; the true meaning came over the last 27 years of military service<br>to our nation.<br>(U) I have stood at the parades, listened to the speeches, and even cried at the ceremonies of<br>soldiers that have given their lives. Words cannot convey the emotions I am filled with each time<br>I hear the National Anthem played. From the striking of the first note, the hairs on my arms<br>stand tall. While the music plays, it seems to bring a sense of pride and responsibility. My<br>thoughts turn to the people who have given their lives and those that still serve today. Though<br>the purpose of Veteran's Day is typically to honor America's living veterans and active forces,<br>and Memorial Day is a time to remember our fallen veterans, I'd ask that you join me in a<br>moment of silence, "Taps", and prayer during our national observance (as described below).<br>(U) National Ceremonies Held at Arlington<br>(U) The focal point for official, national ceremonies for Veteran's Day continues to be the<br>memorial amphitheater built around the Tomb of the Unknowns. At 11 a.m. on November 11th,<br>a combined color guard representing all military services executes "Present Arms" at the tomb.<br>The nation's tribute to its war dead is symbolized by the laying of a presidential wreath. The<br>bugler plays "Taps." The rest of the ceremony takes place in the amphitheater.<br>(U) Every year the President of the United States urges all Americans to honor the commitment<br>of our veterans through appropriate public ceremonies. It is appropriate to include a moment of<br>respect for those who gave their lives for their country.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
