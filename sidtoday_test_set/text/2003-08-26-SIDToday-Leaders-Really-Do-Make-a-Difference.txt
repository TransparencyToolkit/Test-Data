Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 08/26/2003<br><br>(U) Management and leadership, leadership and<br>management. Same thing right? Well, no,<br>management ensures we are doing things right,<br>leadership ensures we are doing the right thing. More importantly,<br>leadership takes us through uncertainty and charts a path where<br>none exists. If not for leadership, we would merely be expertly<br>doing what we did before. Aside from being boring, this is no way<br>to tackle an uncertain future.<br>(U//FOUO) A few years ago, I was the G-2 of the 4th Infantry<br>Division at Ft. Carson, Colorado. We got the call to deploy a<br>battalion-sized element (about 500 men) to Guantanamo Bay,<br>Cuba, to set up an internment camp for Haitian refugees. As<br>staffers, we were required to develop a plan of action for the<br>Commanding General to approve. On the appointed day we briefed<br>our plan to send our combat engineer battalion (suitably<br>augmented with medics and cooks). The engineers were the logical<br>choice since they had equipment and expertise in construction. The<br>General wagged his head and said we would send one of our<br>infantry battalions instead!<br>(U//FOUO) The staff, confused, asked why. The General said he<br>selected the best-led unit in the division rather than the "logical"<br>staff choice. He explained that the mission was going to be hard on<br>the troops and was full of uncertainty. He wanted to bet on<br>leadership rather than technical expertise. Boy, was he right. We<br>went to Cuba and built the camp (on the golf course - which was<br>the only open area - a true heartbreak for the golfers) and it was<br>indeed a tough mission. When the refugees arrived in the<br>oppressive summer heat, they were very angry that they had not<br>been transported to the United States and began to take their<br>anger out on the infantrymen of the 4th Division. Leadership made<br>a difference as the leaders and commanders showed by example<br>the values of the American citizen and the dedication of the men to<br>the refugees' welfare. Leading by example, the Americans pitched<br>in with the emerging refugee leadership to physically improve the<br>camp.<br>(U) The rank and file on both sides saw the establishment of the<br>standards of conduct in this tough situation and joined the team. It<br>was a remarkable turnaround from near riot conditions to<br>cooperative working relationships. Both sets of leaders<br>demonstrated the important function of communicating values and<br>expectations. Leading by example didn't hurt. Leadership made<br>the difference.<br>(U) Leaders keep hope alive. I observed a Haitian doctor minister<br>to the sick and infirm and constantly tell them all that things would<br>be all right. This effort has a self-fulfilling prophecy characteristic.<br>It is the most important gift a leader bestows on his people when<br>things are uncertain or desperate: the gift of hope.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) Charles Berlin<br>Discusses Leadership<br>1.
