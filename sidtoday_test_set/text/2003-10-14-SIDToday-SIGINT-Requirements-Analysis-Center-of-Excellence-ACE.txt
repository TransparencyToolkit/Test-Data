DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) SIGINT Requirements' Analysis Center of Excellence<br>(ACE)<br>FROM: Kevan Barton<br>Chief, Analysis Center of Excellence<br>Run Date: 10/14/2003<br>(U//FOUO) SID spends millions of dollars each year to procure, develop, test, and deploy<br>capabilities. However, we often end up asking ourselves, "Did we actually get the capability we<br>expected?" Our stakeholders are also asking the same question.<br>(U//FOUO) To ensure that we do, in fact, get what we pay for, NSA is following the acquisition<br>and capabilities development processes outlined in DoD5000 and CJCSI 3170 (Joint Capabilities<br>Integration and Development System). The ACE is charged with facilitating and/or performing<br>the independent and objective analyses mandated by these processes, helping SID make sure it:<br>Fully understands its capability gaps<br>Sufficiently explores the solution space to identify suitable solutions that can bridge those<br>gaps<br>Can select the most suitable solution from among many possibilities; and<br>Has the analytic documentation to defend expenditures to stakeholders.<br>(U//FOUO) The ACE had its genesis in the CMM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The CMM AoA<br>provided data to help decide which CMM solution the agency would pay for. This AoA was the<br>first fully documented and reported AoA the agency had done under the 3170 rules. SID<br>leadership didn't want the expertise to escape after the AoA was completed. So, the team<br>moved from CMM to SIGINT Requirements and their portfolio of responsibilities expanded to<br>assisting other SID programs, offices and efforts with this type of analysis. As an example, ACE<br>representatives have been heavily involved in the Site Prioritization Integrated Product Team<br>(IPT), helping SID leadership make strategic decisions about where to deploy future capabilities<br>for the SIGINT system.<br>(U//FOUO) Other SID jobs with which the ACE is currently involved include: conducting a<br>conceptual level analysis of CMM's Government Reference Architecture (GRA); reviewing the<br>investment strategy of the FIS community; and providing expertise to the Space Borne Planning<br>Division, which is participating in the ongoing NRO-led AoA of potential overhead solutions.<br>Additionally, the ACE brings to SID the best decision analysis methods for conceptual level<br>architectural evaluations through its close fraternal relationships with the military services, other<br>community members, and academia.<br>(U) The ACE briefed its methodologies at the community Military Operations Research<br>Symposium (MORS) in June, and continues to mature the community understanding of<br>conceptual architecture evaluations. Next on the horizon for the ACE is to host a communitywide conference in February 2004. The purpose of the conference is to capture the current state<br>of conceptual architecture evaluations in the community and academia.<br>(U) This may all sound unconnected to the mission, but in reality, our job in the ACE is to<br>support the analysis required to get the capabilities SID needs to do the mission.<br>(U) Visit our website or "go ace".
