DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(C) Collection Facility Goes Low-Profile on Okinawa<br>FROM: SIGINT Communications<br>Unknown<br>Run Date: 12/15/2003<br><br>(C) CAMELUS is the NSA coverterm for the Japanese-funded effort to relocate NSA's Hanza<br>Okinawa Remoted Collection Facility (RCF) and its support activities to a location 25 kilometers<br>north, to an area known as Landing Zone Ostrich in the Okinawa Central Training Area (CTA) on<br>USMC Camp Hansen. Why the move? The relocation will shift the highly visible facility from a<br>populated area to a more "low-profile" setting, in accordance with the wishes of the local<br>Okinawa population. When CAMELUS is up and running, the mission at Hanza will be shut down,<br>its mission equipment removed and reutilized elsewhere. The Japanese Government plans to<br>raze the Hanza site and return the land to the original owners after we've moved.<br> <br>The existing antenna array at Hanza.<br>(C//SI) While the Hanza RCF employs a circa 1960 Circularly Disposed Antenna Array (CDAA) sometimes likened to an "elephant cage" - for HF collection (above), the CAMELUS antenna will<br>be smaller, with a lower profile, PUSHER-like antenna. The Japanese Government is paying for<br>all civil work, construction, utilities hookups, and replication of the SIGINT mission-systems. The<br>cost is estimated to be well over $150 million. CAMELUS will provide SID with not only a new<br>collection facility, but also a state-of-the-art HF collection system called STAKECLAIM , a<br>functional replacement for the existing systems at Hanza (LANCER/GRN, TIDY TIPS III,<br>LONGROOT HFDF, and MEDIATOR).<br>Building A at Landing Zone Ostrich<br><br> <br><br> <br>Entire site - Landing Zone Ostrich.<br>(C) CAMELUS Facility construction began on the new site in the spring of 2003. SIGINT Mission<br>system installation and testing will start in the July/Aug 2004 and the current acceptance-date<br>is planned for December 2004.
