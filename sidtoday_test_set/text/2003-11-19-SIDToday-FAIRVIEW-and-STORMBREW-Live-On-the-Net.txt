In September of this<br>year, FAIRVIEW quietly turned on a new DNI (Digital Network Intelligence) collection capability<br>that quickly proved a valuable source of intelligence: A&amp;P;'s Office of Proliferation and Arms<br>Control (S2G21) issued the first SIGINT product report sourced from this new access on<br>September 24. Then, less than a month later, the first E-series product report (extremely<br>sensitive serialized reports sent to a limited audience) was issued by International Security<br>Issues, (S2C21). Many other offices now use this collection, as well - the FAIRVIEW DNI access<br>is extremely high-volume and delivers a very broad target set covering all SIGINT product lines.<br>For example, the initial deployment of the FAIRVIEW DNI access, for e-mail only, is now<br>forwarding more than one million emails a day to the keyword selection system at NSAW.<br>(TS//SI) STORMBREW has a complementary large-scale DNI collection effort (covername<br>PERFECTSTORM) that is just about ready for prime time. As the large-scale effort was being<br>developed, STORMBREW deployed several QRC (Quick Reaction Capability) collection systems<br>that have yielded critical intelligence supporting the Global War on Terrorism. STORMBREW<br>engineers then worked with FAIRVIEW engineers to transfer this collection architecture to<br>FAIRVIEW. Recently, FAIRVIEW identified the "other side" of one of the STORMBREW QRC links,<br>and was able to use the same collection architecture to rapidly put this new link on cover. This<br>type of complementary access provides the A&amp;P; analysts with more complete coverage of their<br>target. In addition, STORMBREW and FAIRVIEW personnel worked side-by-side with CES<br>personnel to add Voice over IP processing capabilities to both of these accesses to further<br>exploit the targets' communications.<br>(TS//SI) In addition to email, FAIRVIEW and STORMBREW are also collecting metadata, or data<br>about the network and the communications it carries. For September 2003 alone, FAIRVIEW<br>captured several trillion metadata records - of which more than 400 billion were selected for<br>downstream processing or storage. This metadata will be used to enable the surgical collection<br>of much smaller amounts of target-rich data - which should extend beyond FAIRVIEW and<br>STORMBREW to many other DNI accesses across NSA. This metadata is flowing to MAINWAY<br>(contact chaining database) today, and a major interface to the Knowledge System Prototype<br>(KSP) is only days away from its operational debut. Both the STORMBREW and FAIRVIEW teams<br>are working closely with the Network Analysis Center, the Collection Strategies and<br>Requirements Center, and analysts throughout A&amp;P; to foster metadata exploitation, focus the<br>access, improve the selectors and filters, and hunt for targets within the access. This<br>collaborative process is the foundation for SIGINT success on the Net.<br>(TS//SI) FAIRVIEW and STORMBREW also provide other major international accesses that<br>support all A&amp;P; SIGINT product lines. In a recent complementary modernization effort, the<br>FAIRVIEW and STORMBREW programs quadrupled SIGINT production from these circuitswitched accesses, only a few months after implementation. As the FAIRVIEW and STORMBREW<br>programs continue to expand their "live" presence on the global net, we are expecting even<br>greater insight into the net itself, and the communications of our targets, resulting in similar<br>SIGINT production gains from these packet-switched accesses.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
