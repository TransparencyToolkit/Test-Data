DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) GEOCELL Supports IRAQI FREEDOM<br>FROM:<br>Chief, GEO<br>Run Date: 04/03/2003<br><br>(S//SI) As a part of the overall SID strategy, the Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO) is among<br>the NSA elements providing 24/7, near-real-time intelligence to coalition forces in Iraq, while<br>still supporting operations supporting the Global War on Terrorism. As NSA prepared for<br>operation IRAQI FREEDOM, the GEO developed and installed interactive metadata mapping<br>layers on a web-based mapping server, and made this server accessible through the Iraq<br>Theater Analysis Cell's (ITAC) Intelink web portal. This site enables specific NSA partners and<br>customers, both in CONUS and forward-deployed, to select, view and analyze geo-location data<br>on Personal Communications Systems (PCS) activity in and around Iraq.<br>(S//SI) As coalition forces have transitioned to combat operations, the GEO Watch has<br>implemented a number of analysis and reporting activities designed to provide identification and<br>tracking of key PCS users in Iraq, and to support the situational awareness and force protection<br>needs of our troops in the field. These GEO Watch activities include near-real-time tipping of<br>communications associated with Iraqi leadership and other high-value targets, change-detection<br>reporting on specific terminals of interest, and immediate tipping of potential threat activity in<br>more than 600 areas of force protection concern in both the CENTCOM and EUCOM areas of<br>interest.<br>(S//SI) In addition, the GEO continues its close coordination with NSOC, the ITAC and other<br>agency elements supporting operations in Iraq, to ensure the continued availability of timely,<br>actionable intelligence to our customers-- SIGINT that makes a difference.
