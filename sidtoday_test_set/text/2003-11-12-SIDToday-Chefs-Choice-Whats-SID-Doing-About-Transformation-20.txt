DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Chef's Choice: What's SID Doing About Transformation 2.0?<br>FROM: Charlie Meals<br>Signals Intelligence Deputy Director<br>Run Date: 11/12/2003<br><br>(S//SI) Lt Gen Hayden recently unveiled the Agency's Transformation 2.0 plan designed to more<br>fully optimize SIGINT for the nation. You may be wondering... "How well is SID moving forward<br>on this initiative?" The good news is that while the challenges in Transformation 2.0 are very<br>formidable indeed, we are actually already engaged. One of the most significant changes since<br>the stand-up of SID is the establishment of our new Issue Manager Team (IMT) effort. The IMTs<br>(see their IMT/WISE webpage ) are already engaged, and helping to lead the way ahead. The<br>IMT construct responds directly to General Hayden's assertion that SIGINT is a team sport;<br>however, as with most new start-ups we are at various stages of the crawl, walk, run<br>progression. So how, specifically, do the IMTs support the goals of Transformation 2.0?<br>(S//SI) Transformation 2.0 calls for extensive information sharing and teaming with a wide<br>variety of partner and client organizations. These can be grouped into four categories:<br>1.  Within NSA (across SID, and between SID and IAD and of course the enabler<br>organizations);<br>2.  Across the Cryptologic Enterprise , to include RSOCs, Mission Ground Sites, Field<br>Entities, Tactical Units, and Foreign Partners;<br>3.  Within the Intelligence Community (our collaborating partners CIA, DIA, NIMA, NRO<br>etc.);<br>4.  With our Clients (military commands, policy makers, law enforcement agencies,<br>Homeland Security, and perhaps industry).<br>IMTs are working hard to bring about seamless cooperation not just within SID but also across<br>the entire SIGINT Enterprise (petals one and two). Experience has proven that this approach<br>delivers high levels of performance and customer satisfaction - the great success of the Iraq IMT<br>is an illustrative example of this "teaming" in action. Our vision is that as we move forward, the<br>IMTs will play an equally important role with petals three and four, which address horizontal<br>integration with our intelligence community partners and with our major clients worldwide.<br>(S//SI) Before we can truly optimize the SIGINT system, we must fully understand national<br>priorities and what we are being asked to do in the context of our customers' intelligence<br>requirements. This raises another, albeit less obvious, information sharing dimension.<br>Transformation 2.0 and "information sharing" are about more than the flow of SIGINT: they are<br>also about coming to a comprehensive understanding of what the customer really wants and<br>then delivering it. The goal is not merely to respond to information needs; it is to be confident<br>every day that we are working the highest national priorities, certain that we are absolutely<br>focused on what the nation needs most. The IMTs, along with the Requirements Analysis Center,<br>will help us focus on the information needs and determine whether SIGINT, or another "INT", is<br>best suited for providing intelligence on a given topic.<br>(S//SI) We are confident that the IMTs will help leverage the SIGINT system to an even higher<br>level of performance. We have identified 14 IMTs, and hand-picked 40 senior analysts to serve in<br>this capacity. The IMTs are not identical in structure - some are fulltime, some are part-time but they all share common goals . SID leadership recognizes this is a significant investment of<br>highly skilled resources, and the fact that we are willing to invest this level of expertise<br>underscores the value and importance of these positions. In the past, we have hired consulting<br>firms to make "system-wide" assessments. These assessments were always insightful and<br>helpful, but unfortunately they were one-off efforts that could not be sustained on a day-to-day<br>basis. To provide the dynamic focus we need today, we are engaging our own experts to help<br>identify problems and take advantage of opportunities to work with all of our resources and<br>partners. The IMTs are here to stay - this is not a one-time event; they will be a continuous<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph">presence to assist in the process of optimizing the SIGINT system.<br>(S//SI) Needless to say, all of this is a tall order; however, as the IMTs progress in their work, I<br>believe we will be positioned to reach new heights of success. I encourage you to support them<br>in every way possible - the outcome will be what our nation deserves: sustainment of the very<br>best SIGINT products and services.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
