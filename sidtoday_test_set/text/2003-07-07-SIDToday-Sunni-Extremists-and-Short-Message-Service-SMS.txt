DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(TS//SI) Sunni Extremists and Short Message Service (SMS)<br>FROM:<br>Arab Sunni Extremism<br>Run Date: 07/07/2003<br><br>(TS//SI) Islamic extremists, including al-Qa'ida, have found the short message service (SMS)<br>capability of their GSM telephones to be a valuable form of communication and have dramatically<br>increased its use during the past 18 months. Extremists employ SMS to send and receive short<br>messages and simple pictures because they believe that SMS is more secure than both voice<br>calls and E-mail, and it certainly is much cheaper than long distance telephone conversations.<br>Another advantage to SMS is that it is convenient and the message gets through: if the<br>recipient's telephone is off when the message is sent, he will get it when he turns his telephone<br>on. In addition, some extremists have used SMS as a COMSEC tool by spreading their messages<br>over three communication modes - voice, SMS and E-mail.<br>(TS//SI) What kinds of messages do they send? Counterterrorism (CT) analysis and reporting of<br>extremist SMS communications have covered a variety of topics. In particular, SMS has been<br>used to arrange instant messaging or chat sessions on the Internet to pass more complex<br>information. Extremists have also used SMS to warn of security problems, especially after raids<br>and terrorist events such as the recent bombings in Riyadh. Moreover, SMS has been used to<br>alert fellow extremists that some event has taken place, such as a bombing, and that they<br>should turn on their televisions or radios for more information. CT has noted that SMS is widely<br>used to coordinate financial transfers, even to include financial transfer reference numbers and<br>specific banks. Another common use of SMS is to pass new E-mail addresses, telephone<br>numbers, and passwords for both computer files and E-mail accounts.<br>(TS//SI) The success of CT SIGINT development efforts to target and collect SMS traffic has<br>created challenges as well as opportunities for analysis and reporting. CT will soon implement<br>SIGINT-on-Demand for SMS reporting to speed up timely dissemination of intelligence and cope<br>with the ever-growing volume of traffic.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
