DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) Message from MG Quirk on Foreign Affairs  Strategic<br>Directions<br>FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA<br>Signals Intelligence Director<br>Run Date: 07/31/2003<br>(U//FOUO) Dan Wolf,<br>, and I have agreed to pursue a new process to ensure we<br>are leveraging our foreign partners to maximum advantage to help accomplish the NSA/CSS<br>SIGINT and IA missions. This new process, which we have designated "Strategic Directions,"<br>responds to the Director's charge to develop a corporate Foreign Affairs program that is agile<br>and responsive in supporting the NSA/CSS cryptologic missions.<br>(U//FOUO) The Strategic Directions initiative uses a "Global Team" (SID, IAD, and FAD)<br>approach to examining SID and IAD needs against a constantly updated set of data on the<br>capabilities of individual partners or groups of partners. The Global Team will bring to the table<br>enough insight and perspective to identify appropriate opportunities, coordinate and deconflict<br>activities across foreign relationships, and then assign to each partner the right role. The same<br>team will consider the needs of our partners, their and our national political objectives, and<br>integrate them into the process.<br>(U//FOUO) When the process is completed, we should find ourselves in a "best fit"situation with<br>each partner, and be able to identify future areas for expanded cooperation with our partners.<br>This process will also lead to more effective planning and budgeting of resources. An added<br>advantage is that it will position us effectively to address the growing demand for performance<br>measures by OMB, Congress, and the White House.<br>(U//FOUO) We have identified an ambitious schedule for this process, leading to results within<br>six months. FAD will take the lead in implementing the Strategic Directions initiative over the<br>next several weeks, and we request your full cooperation on this very important initiative as it<br>becomes integral to the way we in SID, FAD, and IAD conduct our foreign affairs business.<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p>
