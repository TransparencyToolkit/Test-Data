DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U//FOUO) GCCS-I3 Delivers Iraq Intelligence Picture to NSA<br>FROM:<br>National Tactical Integration Office<br>Run Date: 08/11/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) A critical issue facing the Agency as we prepared to support Operation Iraqi Freedom<br>(OIF) was how to gain near real-time visibility into U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM)<br>operations. Our ability to view the battle space from a USCENTCOM perspective was key to<br>keeping the cryptologic system in step with rapidly changing operations. The answer in a<br>nutshell... Global Command and Control System- Integrated Imagery and Intelligence or GCCSI3.<br>What is GCCS-I3?<br>(U//FOUO) GCCS is the primary command and control system for Joint Force Commanders at<br>the Joint Task Force level and above. It presents the Common Operational Picture (COP) to<br>these forces. GCCS-I3 expands GCCS capability by adding a tightly integrated set of intelligence<br>applications and tools. GCCS-I3 applications and tools build the intelligence portion of the COP<br>by integrating the tactical track picture with intelligence reference data from the Military<br>Intelligence Data Base (MIDB). By providing all source integrated intelligence data to the GCCS<br>COP, these tools produce a Common Intelligence Picture (CIP), the theater's all-source, mapbased picture depicting the current USCENTCOM battlespace. GCCS-I3 receives, processes,<br>displays, and maintains current geolocational information on threat, neutral and friendly land,<br>sea, and air forces, resulting in an unprecedented level of streamlined intelligence to support<br>operations.<br>Key NSA Players Use GCCS-I3 to Support OIF<br>(U//FOUO) The Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) National Tactical Integration Office<br>(NTIO) installed GCCS-I3 workstations at critical nodes throughout NSA to support OIF. From<br>the Director's Large Conference room to the NSOC Iraqi Battle Bridge, GCCS-I3 provided key<br>situational awareness information to Agency decision makers.<br>(U//FOUO) The "Battle Bridge" depended on GCCS-I3 for theater-wide Blue Force locations and<br>the corresponding intelligence picture. With unprecedented visibility into USCENTCOM operations<br>via GCCS-I3, the Battle Bridge could quickly focus cryptologic support wherever needed. The end<br>result was greatly improved force protection and targeting support to coalition forces throughout<br>the campaign. The Battle Bridge also relied heavily on GCCS-I3 to prepare the daily Iraq Battle<br>Book and Campaign Update briefings to Senior Agency Management.<br>(U//FOUO) Other organizations, including the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center<br>(CSRC), the NSOC Blue Force Cell, and the Targeting Supporting Activity, relied on GCCS-I3 for<br>critical information. GCCS-I3 performed a synchronizing function among these and other diverse<br>organizations by baselining information upon which decisions were based. The CSRC, for<br>example, was able to quickly tailor collection strategies based on up-to-the-minute knowledge of<br>USCENTCOM operations. The result was more effective use of the SIGINT system and better<br>support to the warfighter.<br>(U) In the Fight...<br>(U//FOUO) Based on the success of GCCS-I3 during OIF, the NTIO is working with NSOC to<br>provide worldwide GCCS-I3 coverage, including full integration of Integrated Broadcast Service<br>(IBS) support. By providing visibility into the tactical battlespace, GCCS-I3 greatly increases the<br>relevance of SIGINT to the warfighter at every level. SIGINT is no longer thought of as a<br>supporting function, but rather, is fully integrated into the campaign from planning through<br>execution.
