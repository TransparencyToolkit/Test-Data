Intelligence analysis is not done by rote. Our tradecraft is, necessarily, dynamic and<br>comprehensive. It is incumbent upon an analyst to keep up with new techniques, to be aware of<br>best practices, and to develop best practices by sharing their own valuable experiences with<br>others in the community. The Analysis Conference is meant to provide these opportunities.<br>(U//FOUO) This year's conference featured more than 80 presentations. Keynote speakers<br>included (in order of appearance):<br>Dr. Mark Lowenthal, A/DCI for Analysis &amp; Production;<br>Dr. John Poindexter, Director Information Awareness Office;<br>Lt Gen Michael Hayden, Director NSA;<br>Lt Gen (Ret.) James Clapper, Director NIMA;<br>MG Richard Quirk, SID Director;<br>Ms. Maureen Baginski, FBI Exec Director for Intelligence;<br> A/DDAP;<br>Dr. William Nolte, Deputy A/DCI for Analysis &amp; Production; and,<br>Mr. Jim Allen, DDAP.<br>Major points that emerged from the talks included: active analysis, building a strong analytic<br>community, and raising the quality vice the quantity of our reporting.<br>(U//FOUO) More than 700 people participated in the conference, including a number of<br>representatives from CSE, GCHQ, DSD, GCSB, CIA, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and<br>our field sites.
