DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Are Leaders Made or Born?<br>FROM: Charles H. Berlin III<br>SID Chief of Staff<br>Run Date: 09/16/2003<br><br>(U) In the last articles we have explored the basis<br>of leadership according to Berlin (you'll find I have<br>an opinion about most everything!). I have<br>received lots of feedback (both way good and way bad) and I am<br>glad it's a topic of discussion. No one seems "blah" about the<br>subject, that's for sure. I maintain that people are good, leadership<br>makes a difference and leaders have to be prepared to lead with a<br>passion for the mission. But any good engineer would make sure<br>this whole equation was feasible first. So the question remains out<br>there: Can leaders be made? Can people be trained to lead? Or are<br>just a few born to it? It's the old nature verses nurture question.<br>(U) Well, here it is, up front: Leaders are made, not born . To<br>be sure, they are not cranked out of a factory. Schooling alone<br>does not a leader make. It takes a combination of schooling,<br>experience, and mentoring to make a leader. Here's the other<br>thing: almost anyone at any level can do it! "Important" position is<br>not required; genius mental capacity is not required; world-class<br>athleticism is not required; and (fortunately for some of us) good<br>looks are not required either. But, at the same time, there are a<br>few qualities that must lie within you to lead. The rest of leadership<br>can be taught. The good news: the required qualities are in all of<br>us to some degree. In my mind it comes down to these three:<br>Heart, Courage and Resiliency.<br>Heart is the trait that keeps a leader from giving up - to<br>push it over the top, to overcome obstacles.<br>Courage is the trait that keeps hope alive - to set sail in<br>uncertainty.<br>Resiliency is the trait that gets you back up when you get<br>knocked down.<br>(U//FOUO) In reality, we are all born leaders to some extent - so I<br>contradict myself a bit - but it's not a simple binary choice, like so<br>many important things. We have these traits in some combination.<br>But it takes a series of training and mentoring events in<br>combination to make us effective leaders. The experience of taking<br>on responsibility is probably the best teacher. It is a test of heart<br>and courage and resiliency every time. Any leader development<br>process must have this component. A series of ever-increasing<br>levels of responsibility is the template of a leader's career. I<br>believe it is a strategic imperative for the Agency to embark on a<br>serious leader development path. You can see the beginnings of<br>this commitment in the Center for Leadership and Professional<br>Development at the NCS. We will need the mentorship part and the<br>workplace experience part to round this out. That's our job as<br>operational leaders. Do we have the program in place? Have you<br>been developed? Have you developed yourself? Have you<br>developed someone else? It's a journey, but one you need not take<br>alone. Want to join me?
