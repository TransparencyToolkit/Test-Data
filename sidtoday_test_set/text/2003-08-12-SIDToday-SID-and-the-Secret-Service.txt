Here, we highlight the SIGINT support angle:<br>(U) Protective Mission Support<br>(S//SI) NSA/SID is closely involved with the US Secret Service (USSS) -- especially with regard<br>to their protective mission -- and has been for quite some time. SID, through the Special<br>Collection Service/Special Operations Division (SCS/SOD), provides Executive Protection close<br>support operations when the President, Vice President, or occasionally other selected<br>governmental officials travel abroad. If the executive is traveling to an area where there is a<br>permanent SCS site, that site is tasked to provide Executive Protection close support. If no<br>permanent SCS site exists, SOD deploys a 3- or 4-person team to the location to be visited by<br>the VIP, usually several days in advance, and conducts 24-hour live coverage while the<br>protectee is in-country.<br>(U) Additional SID Support<br>(S//SI) Other SIGINT support to the Secret Service:<br>SID provides significant intelligence in support of USSS's counterfeit investigative<br>mission, particularly in the area of the North Korean Supernote (i.e. counterfeit highquality $50 and $100 bills produced in NK).<br>SID's Crime and Narcotics Product Line has recently reviewed areas of joint interest<br>concerning collection of Colombian criminal-related activity with the U.S. Secret Service's<br>Criminal Investigative Division (CID).<br>SID's Office of Target Reconnaissance and Survey recently briefed CID on a development<br>effort to geo-locate communications from cellular, pager, and computer targets.<br>Discussions focused on potential testing and evaluation of the system and its potential<br>uses.<br>(S//SI) Secret Service Provides Database Access to SID<br>(S//SI) For its part, the U.S. Secret Service provided NSA/SID access to the Financial Crimes<br>Division (FCD) on-line database. Procedures and log-ins were provided to NSA managers in<br>Follow the Money and Follow the People programs to access FCD databases with particular<br>interest to Mastercard and Visa information. USSS also provided the software and data to load<br>and search the credit card information on NSA's classified web. Once installed, this will give NSA<br>analysts the ability to do real-time, on-line pulls and determine if a particular credit card was<br>issued by a foreign bank.<br>(U//FOUO) For further information on how SID interacts with the Secret Service, contact <br>at <br>or<br> at<br><br>"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet<br>without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."<br><br>DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br>DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108<br><br> </p><p data-reactid=".ti.1.0.0.1.0.1.$1.0" class="SidTodayFilesDetailViewer-pages-page-paragraph"></p>
