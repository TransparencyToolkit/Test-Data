That is, NSA's ability to protect the nation through<br>SIGINT is at severe risk due to the single point of failure represented by the Fort Meade<br>campus. Should NSA lose this campus, the nation would go deaf. Making the problem more<br>difficult is that NSA's assets at Fort Meade represent multi-billons of dollars invested over multidecades. In response to this challenge, the Mission Assurance (MA) project was initiated. The<br>SID MA team is made up of elements from CES , other SID organizations, ITIS, Eagle, LF/Corps<br>of Engineers, Security, CIO, Acquisition and Finance, and others.<br>(S//REL) The SID MA vision has been to protect the nation by protecting the mission, and to do<br>it sooner than anyone could think possible. The strategy involved creating an Intellectual Capital<br>Recovery (ICR) mechanism to store the "blueprints" to the SIGINT factory, as well as creating a<br>24x7 "load-sharing" factory all off of the Fort Meade campus. <br> has been designated as<br>the interim MA facility. The goal is to distribute as much capability as possible in a robust<br>fashion, although at a substantially reduced capacity.<br>(S//SI//REL) Due to financial limitations, <br>equivalent to one year:<br><br> has to be implemented in phases roughly<br><br>Phase 1 in FY03 obtained, prepared, and secured <br> and created the ICR capability.<br>Mission population concentrated on the CES mission.<br>Phase 2 will focus on adding in Analysis &amp; Production and reporting databases and servers, and<br>CARILLON .<br>Phase 3 will add the National Time Sensitive System, Trailblazer, and emergency relocation<br>watch centers for four 24x7 cells.<br>Phase 4 will add in non-COMINT missions, a cryptanalytic expansion, and Special Access<br>Programs.<br>Phase A, running in parallel with Phase 2, will serve to protect the IAD mission.<br>(TS//SI//REL) <br> Phase 1 is now in "limited operational testing". Complete mission stand-up<br>and IOC will occur over the next few months. Because <br> exists due to acts of terrorists on<br>9-11, terrorist-related communications were deliberately chosen to be the first bits sent to <br>. On September 29 of this year, within one fiscal year of initiation, <br> successfully<br>processed its first bits against a terrorist-related target.<br>(TS//REL) <br> a subsequent permanent MA facility or facilities, and the entire MA program<br>have a long way to go. Work to date is necessary but not sufficient. However, the tremendous<br>progress made over the last year has already provided NSA a capability unique in its 50-year<br>history. And, it has come in on time and within the MA budget. The <br> success is a great<br>example of what cross-organizational teaming and a passion for the mission can accomplish.<br>(S//REL) You can help! The SID MA ICR back-up and restoration teams want to hear from you.<br>If you have critical softcopy Intellectual Capital (e.g. source code trees, scripts, target<br>knowledge databases, etc.) we want to ensure that your systems have been identified and,<br>shortly, added to the list of items to be backed-up at <br>.
