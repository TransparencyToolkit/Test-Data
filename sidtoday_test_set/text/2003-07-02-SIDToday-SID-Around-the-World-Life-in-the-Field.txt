DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) SID Around the World: Life in the Field<br>FROM:<br>NCEUR/CApps Chief of Staff (F26)<br>Run Date: 07/02/2003<br><br>(U//FOUO) When I was asked to write about life in the Field, for<br>"SID Around the World", my only challenge was to keep my<br>comments to a few paragraphs. I arrived at NSA/CSS Europe<br>(NCEUR), Cryptologic Applications Directorate (F26), in Stuttgart,<br>Germany, just over a year ago as the Chief of Staff. Although I<br>started my career as a SIGINTer, I had been managing training and<br>HR organizations for several years. Coming to NCEUR has allowed<br>me to re-enter, at least in part, the SIGINT world. The Cryptologic<br>Applications (CApps) Directorate is co-located with, and provides<br>support to, the U.S. European Command HQ, on Patch Barracks.<br>(U//FOUO) This is my fifth overseas assignment, having served<br>one tour in Korea on active duty, two tours as a military spouse in<br>Greece and Japan, and two as an NSA civilian in England and<br>Germany. As a result, I can say authoritatively that the best part of<br>life in the field is travel. Stuttgart is in a great location since we<br>can travel to most of Germany, as well as France, Switzerland, or<br>Austria in a matter of a few hours. The rest of Europe is easily and<br>inexpensively accessed as well. As a single parent with a daughter<br>in college, my daughter also benefits from my tour abroad since<br>she is able to spend her Christmas and summer breaks in Europe.<br>In one year she has already traveled with me to England, France,<br>Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands. We still have two years to<br>go!<br>(U) Each country I have lived in has had a slightly, or sometimes<br>radically, different lifestyle. However, the common thread has been<br>that I have learned to respect other ways of life, and learned that<br>"our" way is not the only way. A Field experience is a tremendous<br>benefit for kids and is something that will impact them their entire<br>life. They learn to appreciate differences and become more flexible- both excellent life skills!<br>(U//FOUO) I was asked what I will miss most when I leave<br>Stuttgart. I think I will miss the friends that I have made here, and<br>will continue to make throughout my tour. When you work in the<br>field, you not only work with your colleagues, but tend to socialize<br>with them as well. Although some might not agree, I believe life in<br>the Field creates a stronger bond than a traditional work<br>relationship. Although that is not everyone's "cup of tea", I have<br>found my most rewarding friendships have been those from my<br>field tours. I have had a wonderful 18-year career at the Agency,<br>but can say without hesitation that my Field experiences have been<br>the greatest benefit of my career.<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.
