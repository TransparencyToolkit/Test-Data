DYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS<br>TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL<br><br>(U) Spanning The Globe...Misawa to Menwith Hill: Part 2<br>FROM:<br>Software Development Team Menwith Hill Station<br>Run Date: 10/23/2003<br><br>(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: This is the conclusion of a<br>two-part article.<br>(U) Language Struggles<br>(U) Some folks are intimidated by the language differences when<br>moving to Japan, but I found that I could communicate effectively<br>using "international charades". Plastic food on display and menus<br>with pictures were also helpful. Most road signs display English and<br>Japanese and larger train stations have a tourist information kiosk<br>with English maps and brochures. The key to success is to not be<br>intimidated. We spoke only enough Japanese to be polite (please,<br>thank you, excuse me) and to say "I don't understand" and we<br>travelled the country, used the train system, and stayed at<br>Japanese hotels.<br>(U) Speaking "English" is quite a different beast. At least in Japan I<br>knew I didn't speak the language, but I thought I spoke the same<br>language as they do in England. I have discovered that I speak<br>"American" and not "English" and definitely not "Scottish"!<br>(U) Daily Life<br>(U) On-base life in Misawa is similar to living in a small town in the<br>US. There is a hospital, 3 schools, a movie theater, 2 gyms, a mall<br>(of sorts), a large commissary, and tons of housing, just to hit the<br>high points. Misawa AB is HUGE compared to RAF Menwith Hill.<br>While the goods, services and infrastructure may exist, they are<br>very limited at Menwith. The flip side is that in England, you can<br>usually get comparable goods and services on the economy (and<br>you can read the packaging). If you get desperate and need that<br>Taco Bell or Cinnabon fix, RAF Lakenheath is less than a 4 hour<br>drive south and it is a large base.<br>(U) Off-base, our favorite ramen shop (next to Viking's) has been<br>replaced by our local pub (The Flying Dutchman in<br>Summerbridge), tempura has been replaced by fish and chips, and<br>Sapporo Beer by Theakstons Old Peculiar. Georgia coffees hot from<br>the vending machine will never be replaced, but tea at Betty's is a<br>pleasant substitute. 100 Yen stores have been replaced by the<br>January Sale at Harrods, and Tokyo never had a chance against<br>London. We do wish there was a way to package and export the<br>relaxing and warming effects of the onsen (Japanese communal<br>hot bath).<br>(U) When we agreed to PCS to Misawa, we both envisioned we<br>would do our 3 years and move on to better assignments. We did<br>not think that we would stay an extra year and we never thought<br>we would miss anything from Japan. We were wrong. As I type<br>this, I'm sipping on a Georgia coffee shipped by a friend from<br>Japan. It's just one of the many things we miss (and an addiction I<br><br> SERIES: <br>(U) SID Around the<br>World '03<br>1.  Coming Soon: SID<br>Around the World!<br>2.

Fortunately, England has been able to<br>provide many acceptable substitutes and several things that I know<br>we will miss when we PCS (Cadbury!).<br>(U) We had a super experience in Misawa professionally and<br>personally and we both look back fondly on those 4 years. The jury<br>is still out on our Menwith Hill experience, but if the first 5 months<br>are any indication, it will rival if not surpass our Misawa adventure.<br>(U//FOUO) If you are thinking of applying for a field position, see<br>the Extended Enterprise Vacancy Announcements .
